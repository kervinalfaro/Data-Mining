  Deep Work is the execution/tactical companion to Newport's last book, So Good They Can't Ignore You and it doesn't disappoint.These books should be taken together as a whole because they give you the WHAT, the WHY and the HOW for being an elite knowledge worker.So Good they Can't Ignore you shows you why building valuable and rare skills, which Newport calls ""career capital"" is the number one most important thing for finding a job you love (not ""finding your passion""). Building that capital allows you to find a job where you can have creative control over your work and more control over your time, which allows you to do ""deep work,"" aka deliberate practice (and the 10,000 hour rule for expertise, Gladwell, Ericsson and others). There are also 2 other factors, choosing a domain or mission or project where you will have a postive impact on the world, and choosing to work with people who you like being around, which aren't covered much but Newport assumes you should be able to figure out on your own.Summary of what you need to be So Good They Can't Ignore You1. Rare and valuable skills (aka career capital)2. Creative control over projects3. Control over your time (which allows you to do deep work, virtuous cycle)4. Work that has a positive impact on the world5. Working with people you enjoy being withHere's the formula:-Use deep work to learn fast and build up rare and valuable skills.-Then apply these rare and valuable skills to the right projects so that you can build up career capital.-Then cash in the career capital to get more creative and time control over your job.-All the while, try to pick jobs and projects that have a positive impact and allow you to work with good people.-However, these are usually also things that you need to trade in your career capital (rare skills and experience using them) in order to maximize.-Don't try to save the world or have a big impact until you have the career capital to match. Otherwise you will probably fail. You have to earn all these perks via building career capital by using deep work.So Good They Can't Ignore You doesn't spend much time explaining how to actually implement deep work (deliberate practice) into you life. It tells you to focus deeply, stretch yourself cognitively and get constant high quality feedback on your work/output.That's where Deep Work comes in. Deep Work shows you exactly WHY deep work is so important (as opposed to Shallow Work), especially for modern knowledge workers, and why the way most people work, with constant interruptions from social media, email and their phones, is holding most knowledge workers back from  being successful and competitive in today's job market.The first part of the book argues for why Deep Work is important. If you have already bought into the idea, you can skim this part, but I found the examples and people he featured to be very interesting so it's worth a read. Just don't expect a lot of tactics until part 2.Chapter 1 explains why deep work is VALUABLE. Our economy is changing, and the days of doing the same thing over and over for 40 years until you retire are over. Newport lays out an interesting theory for 3 types of workers, Superstars, Owners and High Skill Workers and makes a convincing and important argument for the importance in the future of being able to work at higher levels of abstraction and work with intelligent machines.In this chapter he also makes a case for the two critical skills for knowledge workers:1.  Learning Quickly2. Producing at an Elite LevelThis conclusion informs the rest of the book. If you want to be good at these two skills, the most important thing to be good at is deep work.Chapter 2 focuses on why deep work is RARE. He shows how distractions are becoming more and more common for knowledge workers, and that attention is becoming more and more fractures. Newport makes a good case for how complex knowledge work is often hard to measure, so managers measure busyness instead of output that relates to bottom line results (KPIs). Busyness as a vanity metric. People end up optimizing for looking busy instead of getting real work done, and everybody plays along with this charade.Chapter 3 goes into why deep work is MEANINGFUL. Meaning is a key part of Newport's argument because the whole book links back to the Passion vs. Rare Skills debateÃ¢â‚¬Â¦which is a better strategy for finding a job you love? If the job isn't meaningful, then deep work doesn't fully answer the question of how to best find a job you love.  Newport give 3 theories on why deep work is meaningful, a psychological, neurological and a philosophical reason.That's it for part 1.In Part 2, Newport tells you how to implement deep work into your day to day life with 4 rules.Rule 1 gives you a bunch of strategies and examples of how to integrate deep work into your schedule.  He offers different strategies depending on what kind of work you do. The Grand Gestures part of this chapter is really good, you learn about Bill Gates Think Week and same famous authors who go to secluded islands or build cabins to get a lot of deep work done when necessary. There is also a section here on execution using the 4 Disciplines from Clayton Christensen's work. The point on lead vs. lag measures is really good.Rule 2 covers the idea of embracing boredom. Newport gives a number of strategies for doing two important things: improving your ability to focus and eliminating your desire for distraction. At first these seem like the same thing but Newport explains why they are actually two different skills. For example, someone who is constantly switching between social media and infotainment sites can block off time for deep work but they won't be able to focus if they can't control their desire to always have instant gratification and constant stimulus. The point about making deep work your default, and scheduling shallow work in between is also a game changer.Rule 3 is about social media sites and infotainment sites. This rule isn't as strategic as the other ones, it's mostly about making a side argument that these networking sites aren't as important is you think they are. He gives some good strategies for measuring what sites and services you should include in your day to day life based on the total collection of all the positive and negative effects. This sort of critical thinking and measurement usually doesn't get applied to these kind of sites.Rule 4 is about draining the shallows, meaning going through the process of eliminating as much as possible shallow work from your daily schedule. This is more tactical chapter, (This and Rule 1 are the most useful of the 4) you learn how to plan out your day, how to stop from bringing your work home with you with an end of day ritual and how to manage your email so that you cut down on the amount of time you spend in your inbox each day. There is also a strategy for how to talk to your boss about deep work so you can get permission to re-arrange your schedule to be more productive.Overall Thoughts:This book, and Newport's previous book So Good They Can't Ignore You, are some of the most important books you will read on planning your career.Most people spend little to no time on these decisions, or just go with the flow or with how other people approach things, even though this planning process will affect the next 4 to 5 decades of their life.Most people's thinking is still stuck in the industrial economy way of thinkingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦it makes sense thought, our education system is also stuck in this way of thinking. Deep work gives you a solid, actionable plan and doesn't leave anything out that I can think of.

  I have generally been a fan of Cal's work, but had a mixed view on this book.  TL DR: It has some good actionable steps, but with a lot of fluff about being more counter-culture and revolutionary than it is or needs to have.The Good1. Cal highlights actionable ways to 1) increase concentration and focus and 2) produce more work output.  He specifically delineates between ""shallow"" low priority work and ""deep"" high-priority, high-payoff work and ways to identify which types of work fall into which category.2. Cal anticipates more of the (valid) objections and nuances to his thesis than I've seen him do previously.  I thought his discussions on professions like CEOs that might not be deep-work appropriate, different ways to think about what social media improves your life, and going off-schedule to pursue an insight made the book much more well-rounded and connected to life.The Not-so-good1. The book is written as if it's presenting ""a new, flashy, grand theory of everything"".  It's not that.  The idea of working in a deep, focused manner isn't a new one or one that would shock people (as the book's extensive citations show).  But the book puts up a very intense battle against an army of straw men.  I don't think you'd find anyone who disagrees with the general notion of working intensely on your priorities; it's making your life conducive to it (and getting done what you aim to get done when you sit down) that's the hard part.  So the book feels more to me like ideas you'd share with friends about how to be more productive than a revolutionary new idea, but you have to wade through *pages* of why this is *life-changing* and *flashy* to get to the more useful actionable steps.2. I think that deep work is a very large umbrella term that could be broken down.  For example, the way in which brainstorming or writing an academic paper stretches your brain is very different from the way in which editing a paper (p. 228) stretches your brain.  Cal identifies all of these as deep work, but more thought on how you attack very different types of deep work would be helpful.  For example, the open-ended process of generating an idea and getting it on to paper requires a different process than the mind-numbing tedium of final paper edits.  I would have liked more thinking through the ""initial attack"" and then the ""follow-through"".

  Newport starts out with a good (albeit obvious) idea that one can get much higher quality work done by getting rid of the constant distractions and interruptions surrounding us -- like tv, smart phones, email, and social media. Thereby allowing your mind to become deeply focused on the task at hand. I think we can all remember times when we have achieved this state whether it was writing a paper, building a model, drawing a picture, reading a novel, writing a computer program, putting a puzzle together, etc. We can also all remember how good it felt to be that focused and that productive. So his premise for this book is a good one even if for no other reason than to point out how we have let social media take over so much of our time -- that we have become constantly `on call' and therefore don't think as deeply about things anymore. That we should force ourselves to disconnect once in a while.The problem with Newport's book is that the above ideas are not enough material for an entire book. So he needs to fill out the book with interesting stories and related facts. This is where Newport gets sloppy, goes off the rails, and ruins the book. He contradicts himself over and over. Starting out by saying one needs time isolated, undistracted, alone, to be totally focussed on a task for several hours at a minimum, and then contradicting this by saying we should work in teams, or first that we ignore the smart phone and later put a stop watch phone app on our desk which we can constantly glance at to make sure we stay there for a certain time, etc. He even inserts bizarre asides that are completely irrelevant to his `deep work' topic such as card memorization tricks that have nothing to do with deeply  concentrating on a task and entering the `deep work' state. Newport's editors at the publishing company clearly didn't bother pointing out the many contradictions, irrelevant distractions, and non-sequiturs riddled throughout this book.`Deep Work', as Newport calls it, is sort of the work analogue of rem sleep, it is a state of concentration that only comes after you work undistracted for a certain amount of time. The amount of time needed to achieve this state differs between people and you get better at it with practice. In fact, contrary to what Newport says, some people can do it without the isolation. They can simply put their phone in airplane mode and shut everything out. Like the guy on the subway reading or writing who is completely oblivious to everything around him. A bomb could go off and he wouldn't even notice. In other words, contrary to Newport's initial (contradicted later) premise, we don't need to retreat to a proverbial `mountain shack' to achieve this productive state. In fact, I am in the state now, writing this. Yes, the mountain shack helps, but it is not required.It became clear by the end of the book that Newport has decided to write Malcolm Gladwell type `techno self help books' for two reasons: 1) to pad his resume, and 2) to make money.The first is clear by the importance he places on the number of books and articles people pump out (falling in to the `publish or perish' trap of academia) repeating yearly publication rates over and over for himself and others -- quantity not quality; and the second is clear by the importance he places on riches and rich people. How rich you will get, how irreplaceable and therefore highly paid you will be, etc., if you are a deep worker guy. Although this may just be his awareness of the values driving his target audience -- i.e. tech entry level programmers types or software sales types who went into CS or business school to make money. In otherwords the type of high level software tech guy who idolizes Bill Gates and has never heard of Dennis Richie or Richard Stallman. (Newport himself not have heard of them either)It is also annoying that he talks forcefully about deleting your twitter or your facebook account and then reveals later that he has never even had a facebook account! That is like complaining about the number of people addicted to `game of thrones', saying it is a worthless waste of time and they should stop watching it, only to reveal he has never seen an episode of the show!Look, I agree that social media is a distraction and one should not allow it to constantly interrupt your concentration throughout the day, but lets not start deleting every modern tool just because they can be addicting. Instead learn moderation! Alcohol can be addjcting too, but there are 10 people who enjoy relaxing with a scotch or glass of wine in the evening for every addicted alcoholic. Facebook provides pleasure and relaxation to people -- which is exactly why it can be addicting. The secret is moderation, not elimination.Also, all of his talk about how long your mind can remain in `deep work' mode per day is pure made up nonsense. Four hours? He has no clue. Nor should he. In fact, it is likely different for different people and completely dependent on how long you have practiced it. People have gone for weeks, months, or even longer in that state (when proving Fermat's Last Theorem, Andrew Wiles went for 7 years!) Isaac Newton for example, would work so hard on a problem that he would forget to eat, he would dream about it, and it would totally consume him for weeks at a time. I heard a story, written by a fellow Cambridge professor and fellow member of the Royal Society who said Newton would emerge from his rooms, ostensibly to get some dinner, and would walk a certain distance lost in thought and completely oblivious to his surroundings. He would then suddenly  stop and look around. Clearly having forgotten why he had left his rooms and he would then turn around, go back to his rooms, and continue working. Now that is what I call prolonged `deep work' -- forget about social media, not even hunger could interrupt Newton .Anyway, I could go on but I won't bore you with further complaints.Read ""On Writing"" by Stephen King and you will get a much more substantial and informative discussion of how to work, to create, and to go 'deep'. King's version of ""deep work"" is outlined beginning on page 151 (sections 2, 3, and 4 of the part entitled 'on writing') and I think he really nails it. Stephen King is both prolific and humble (he is also filthy rich for those of you who think that fact is important), and he certainly proven he knows how to achieve deep concentration. Search ""22 lessons by Stephen King"" sometime. They apply equally well to any 'deep' creative task in my opinion.Summary: Make time in your life to go distraction free when you have an important creative endeavour to work on. Put your devices in airplane mode and retreat to your proverbial `mountain shack'. Do it as often, as for as long, as it takes to finish that creative endeavour. Then turn your devices back on and rejoin the rest of us out here in social media land. Tell us about your cool creation so that we can enjoy it as well and we can compliment you on how cool it is and how much hard work you did to accomplish it. However, don't brag too much or toot your own horn too much okay? Let us do that. Your creation shows your value without needing adornments about your publication rate, your million tasks accomplished -- and with children in their terrible twos!, your MIT education, your Georgetown professorial eliteness, and the rest. All that tooting just makes you look insecure.In fact, by the end of Newport's book, it made me want to read a book written by his wife. I bet she would tell a revealing tale.

  On page 136, the author says, ""I discovered the gap between what and how was relevant to my personal quest to work more deeply."" The first 135 pages of this book are the 'what'. I'll sum it up for you and save you some time: We're all distracted because our brains like distraction and also because our bosses like us to look busy."" Pretty sure we all knew that by now. You still have to mine through the next 120 or so pages to get to the 'how' nuggets of deep work.  The 'rules' that are mentioned in the title. I'll give you some hints - routine helps, facebook sucks, and boredom is the birthplace of creativity. I wanted to love this book. I'm a writer, and staying focused is tough. But I felt a lot of this book was redundant and finding the nuggets of help and inspiration was annoying.

  Cal Newport gives us a very specific definition for the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Deep WorkÃ¢â‚¬Â in his title. Here it is.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.Ã¢â‚¬ÂDeep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World is based on what the Cal Newport calls his Deep Work Hypothesis:Ã¢â‚¬Å“The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.Ã¢â‚¬ÂWhy do the hard work of deep work?Newport believes that the ability to do deep work will help you master hard things quickly and perform at an elite level. And he thinks that those skills are key to success in the coming decades. This book is about wringing the most value you can out of your time by spending some of it on deep work.Not a new idea, but an important onePeople have been writing about working in long, uninterrupted stretches of time for quite a while. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find it in Peter DruckerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s book, The Effective Executive, written in the 1960s. Then it might make you more successful. Today, Newport thinks itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a survival skill. He thinks that the world will be divided into two kinds of performers in the future. One group will not master deep work and will slide down the performance curve. The other group will master deep work and will be more successful and more satisfied.An important idea that pushes back against our work cultureWhat Newport is calling for in terms of concentration and effort goes against the grain of the current work culture. Today we think that being connected 24 hours a day and 7 days a week is normal. We donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t see anything strange about a person stopping in the middle of a dinner conversation to check email. Yet, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s exactly the opposite of the behavior that Newport recommends.How to get the deep work doneThe author suggests six strategies for getting the deep work done. I found those interesting reading but not particularly helpful, with one exception. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the advice to: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Decide on your in-depth philosophy.Ã¢â‚¬ÂThat will be particularly helpful for you because it gives you different ways to approach the idea of doing deep work, no matter what kind of situation youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re in. My only quibble here is that I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think you just decide and do it. I think youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll try things out, find what works, and maybe combine the philosophies so that they work best for you.After going through some of the basics, Newport defines the problem accurately by noting that it is a problem of execution, not a problem of understanding. Knowing that deep work is important and understanding how it works wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make a pinch of difference without an execution strategy.He recommends the strategy from a 2012 book called The 4 Disciplines of Execution: Achieving Your Wildly Important Goals. That book lays out four specific disciplines that Newport applies one after another to the process of doing deep work.Focus on the wildly important. Not just Ã¢â‚¬Å“important,Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬Å“wildly important.Ã¢â‚¬Â Pick one or two things that will make the biggest difference for you and work on those. As many authors have said, you will accomplish more with a few goals that you concentrate on rather than with many goals that distract you and suck up your energy.Act on the lead measures. Measure what you need to do to get the results you want. Do that and the results will take care of themselves.Keep a compelling scoreboard. Keeping score and keeping records keeps you honest and helps you make more progress.Create a cadence of accountability. This is a lot like scrum. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just do deep work. Have someone or a team that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re accountable to and to whom you report regularly.Is this book for you?This is a good book, especially if you are new to the idea of what deep work represents: long, uninterrupted stretches of work that push you to your limits. The material on execution includes ways to work in teams and to mix creativity and innovation to produce more and better work.There are some things that you should be aware of before you consider buying the book. The first part of the book seems very helpful, but then effectiveness tails off. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not unusual in business books, which tend to start strong and then peter out. This one keeps going, but the second half of the book is not nearly as sharp or as helpful as the first.There are lots of powerful insights in the book. Even if you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t buy the entire process, or if you buy it but donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t entirely put it to work, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll pick up some tips and tricks that will make you more productive. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one, for example, about not taking breaks from the distractions, i.e. checking your email. Instead, take breaks from your deep work. You work, you take a break and you do the distractions then.There was another one that was particularly helpful for me about developing a shut-down ritual at the end of the day. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been working on things in a kind of deep work way for years, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what writers do. What I had not mastered was the ability to shift from my work day to home without a fairly long transition period. The close-out ritual has helped with that, though IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m still struggling to master it. The problem is with me, not the concept.On a personal note, I would have liked the book better if there were more business examples as opposed to academic examples of ways to make this work. In fact, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d have preferred more examples from someone other than Cal Newport.Bottom lineThis will be a good book for you if you want to improve the amount and quality of your personal work. It will help you get things done with teams. It will give you a number of productivity tips, whether you go for the whole book or not.On the downside, the book is probably longer than it needs to be. The most important Ã¢â‚¬Å“downsideÃ¢â‚¬Â has nothing to do with the book. If you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t put what you learn to work, it will have no value for you. In the case of deep work, that means making changes to your work routines and habits. It will take you months or years, not days or weeks, to get the value thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s here for the taking.

  If you've never heard that concentration on a task leads to better outcomes, by all means buy the book.If you're searching for strategies to accomplish concentration, you might find help here, but you'll be trawling through an ocean of tangentially relevant opinions.If you are curious about the author's psychology and life world, there's an abundance of insight.But for most of us there's little new here and very little that's applicable outside of common sense: if you're distracted, you loose concentration. If you've lost concentration, it will be harder to deliver results. To deliver results, set time aside, even if it's only 30 minutes a day. And go work hard.But please don't spend money on this book!

  Ordered this 48 hours ago on a whim and...it has consumed me.First off, howdy Cal! We're neighbors! Loved the recommendation for Smith Meadows grass fed meat.Love the vernacular as well. Cal is an outstanding writer, and from one writer to another, superbly impressed by this.  Favorite word I think is heuristic.I purchased the kindle version and actually got so, so much from this book that I copied into ""Notes"" for personal review that eventually I got a message error saying ""copy limit reached""!There is just so much use included in this book, backed by an entirely action-driven plan complete with science-backed evidence. Cal stays clear more or less of the political and philosophical debates (he dabbles, but not much at all)I'm not a fan of people including summaries in their review, I think that's wildly unethical actually, so all I will say is you're looking for a way to become more efficient and successful, this book is not to be missed. Only regret not reading it sooner.P.s. During the reading thought of the potentiality of using Pavlovian cues to start/end blocks of deep work...perhaps a series of bells or sounds, each individual to the start or end of a particular area of deep work. This could potentially help the mind become more accustomed to the start and stop of said work.Love, love, love this book. Will re-read often! Thanks, Cal!

  I came across Deep Work as a recommendation by someone on Hacker News. It was a thread on the best books read recently, and I forget which exactlyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ so I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t post the referral link hereÃ¢â‚¬Â¦The reason why I decided to get this book was mostly that I wanted to take a break from the glut of technical reading I had been doing at the time. I also tend to like to read self help books, so itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s very fitting that I had gone with this particular piece.Deep Work definitely resonated with me as with all self-help books tend to do IF you already buy into everything a self-help books already suggests. As it turns out, I had already practiced most of the philosophies Professor Cal already advises.In summary, the deep work philosophy requires one to be very disciplined with their limited time and use that time effectively to get non-trivial work done. The non-trivial work in this case tends to be work that does not give one immediate satisfaction of productivity, but rather a sense of satisfaction of working towards a bigger goal or completed work with more meaning.How that gets done is mentioned by Newport in that to become effective and deep work we must:We live in an economy where we now need to possess a certain set of qualities to be successful. There are 3 categories: First the people who can use their tools effectively to do more than the people who are in the same position to innovate. Second, the people who possess highly technical skills who are sought after to contribute to the economic machine and finally the people who have enough capital to use to get things done. Most people can work to bring themselves into the first two categories.Treat our task and job as if completing it brings innovation to the world. Become a craftsman at what you do.Gauge whether or not the use of social media is actually necessary. They tend to be distractions.Plan and schedule effectively. Know when you are productive and take advantage of that time.We can only be productive for so long. (1Ã¢â‚¬â€œ4 hours) Knowing this fact will let us know when to call it quits.Know when to call it quits. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stress about the things that can happen after the work day. Just create a game plan for how to solve the outstanding issues for the next time you pick up your tasks again and come to admit that you are Ã¢â‚¬Å“at a good placeÃ¢â‚¬Â.Deep Work: LEARN NEW THINGS QUICKLY and BECOME AN EXPERT AT NEW THINGS.I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to become more productive, or needs confirmation if one already believes they are productive. For me, it was the latter. I wanted to make sure that I was on the right track personally for my own growth. This book did just that.If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not into self-help books, I would probably go to the local book store and give this one a skim anyway. :)

  Simply put, one of the best books on my shelf to date. This book is exactly what youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d expect from Cal Newport, and in my opinion went above my expectations after I read it. I like how he incorporates both science and old-world philosophy into a well-written presentation that keeps the reader eager to turn the page. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s amazing how much you can start implementing what you read in here to real life to change your own ways of focus/habit/elimination of distraction all in one. I am glad I listened to all the good reviews I read, and now I leave you with a 5-Star review as well. Recommend to people wanting to go deeper in their work or for those who struggle to just get things done efficiently. This could help so many people, so why not give it a try? Take my word for it. Besides, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a pretty inexpensive book too.

  I'm happy to see that only the first third of the book was dedicated to the theory supporting his ideas. The advice offered was good but mostly applies to persons who have already achieved some autonomy in their professional lives or have external support. This book could be better if more information was provided from people from other walks of life. We are not all on a tenure track for professor. Neither are we Bill Gates or some other tech guru. What are the strategies for a regular kid who has to earn a living through school to achieve deep work? A single mom? He mentioned J.K. Rowling as an example, but not the strategies employed by the struggling J.K. Rowling (a more valuable lesson I'm sure). He described how the rich version could afford to sequester herself  in a fancy hotel and write. I'm more interested in how she managed the deep work on her first book when she was probably scared and desperate. I'm more interested in how people with challenges employ deep work and succeed. I'm not really interested in knowing yet again how people who have support and can take extended lunch breaks achieve deep work. Also, the advice on how to manage email and social media was not very nuanced. A little more research into strategies employed by people who need to read (and answer!) their email and maintain a social media presence would have improved this book as well.

  The Deep Work Hypothesis: The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.Newport, Cal (2016-01-05). Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World (p. 14). Grand Central Publishing. Kindle Edition.An exceptional book - useful from the first few pages. I've enjoyed Cal Newport's other books, and his blog Study Hacks, for quite awhile, so I was very excited to read this. It's very well written - Newport has a very clear, concise writing style that helps you get what you need from the material and apply it readily. He discusses the suitability of his processes for different types of careers, even examining those jobs that *might* not benefit from deep work, at least as much other professions. he's very practical in his recommendations and organized in his presentation. He's also taken the time to provide fairly exhaustive references. I loved ""So Good They Can't Ignore You,"" and this I enjoyed even more. Very highly recommended.A thought (quote) that keeps coming up for me lately is this, ""Our brains instead construct our worldview based on what we pay attention to."" Newport, Cal (2016-01-05).  It's so obvious really, but the implications should give one pause when constantly looking to social media to relieve our boredom.

  The book opens with a focus on Nate Silver as an example of great success in the modern distracted world.  It even goes so far as to cite an incredibly basic SQL query as evidence of the extreme complexity involved in Nate's work. Haha.Anyway, I ceased to read after that.  Nate predicted one of the most predictable wins in US political history (Obama's election) and missed the next most predictable (Trump's).  Being right half the time doesn't a great case study make.  If the book is flawed so obviously at this early stage, I don't really trust anything beyond it.This will sit on my bookshelf sinking under the weight of gathering dust for twenty years until it's tossed in the trash in a future spring clean as one of those outdated books we can laugh at whilst saying: ""Remember when people believed this sort of thing?""

  This book has assisted me greatly in improving my focus and work. I found the advice so important that I wrote a one-pay summary that I provide others when I recommend the book to them.  Here is that summary.Deep Work: Activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive abilities to their limit. These efforts are crucial to accomplishing difficult tasks and improving abilities.Shallow Work: Non-cognitively demanding, logistical-type tasks, often performed while distracted.Network tools work against deep thinking/work.  Connectivity creates little tasks that upon completion falsely result in a productive feeling. Our brain always responds to distractions.  Multi-tasking has attention-residue that causes inefficient performance and thwarts deep-thinking. Depth-destroying instances are difficult to detect.  Behaviors that are easiest at the moment interfere with deep thinking/deep work. Busyness is not nor does it promote deep thinking/work, but is a seductive substitute for productivity.  The least resistance is short-term satisfaction that avoids the discomfort of concentration that leads to real meaning and long-term satisfaction.Focus requires reducing and, for extended periods, eliminating distraction. The benefits are professional (more meaningful thinking and work) and personal (more meaningful thinking and time with those who matter). Deep thinking is connected to a good life.Let your mind become a lens, thanks to the converging rays of attention; let your soul be all intent on whatever it is that is established in your mind as a dominant, wholly absorbing idea (Antonin-Dalmace Sertillanges, Dominican friar & professor of moral philosophy)To learn requires intense concentration (an act of deep work).  Deliberate practice focused attention and feedback to maintain focus.Replacing distraction with focus is difficult. Execution is more difficult than strategies.Work with others, but then often retreat to work alone.  Deep thinking/work can occur with others (Collaborative deep work), but everyone must be committed to such efforts. Even then, the individuals often retreat to work alone.You must batch hard important intellectual work into uninterrupted stretches. Sometimes days, but never less than an hour. Establish times and distraction-free environments.  The following are strategies. The bimodal and rhythmic strategies require great discipline!Monastic strategy Ã¢â‚¬â€œ two or three times a year go to a quiet location for deep thinking, work, and relaxation.Bimodal strategy Ã¢â‚¬â€œ dedicate clearly defined periods of time to deep thinking/work (e.g., one 8-hour day each week).Rhythmic strategy Ã¢â‚¬â€œ set hard stretches of time each day for deep thinking/work (no shorter than 1-2 hour stretches).Journalistic strategy Ã¢â‚¬â€œ shift into deep work on a momentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s notice.Routines and rituals are absolutely required (the most important meta strategy) for deep thinking/work. Establish:Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Where you will work and for how long (schedule 30-minute blocks all day, batching similar things, particularly shallow tasks):Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ How you will work once you begin; andÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Efforts you will make to support your deep thinking/work time.Create a stake (grand gesture) that makes more likely you will follow through with your effort at deep thinking/work.Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Focus on what is extremely important. All activities require time. Spend 80% of your time/attention on high impact activities.Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Act on lead measures; behaviors that will drive success on lag measures (what you are seeking to improve).Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Maintain a scoreboard of hours spend deep thinking/working and link to accomplishments.Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Establish regular accountability checks.Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Establish downtimes. Put more thought into your leisure time and make purposeful choices.Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Finish your work day at an established time. Create a shutdown ritual that includes (a) quickly reviewing email inbox to ensure urgent messages have been addressed; (b) transfer new tasks onto your task list; (c) skim task list and calendar for the upcoming days to be mindful of important deadlines/obligations and time-frame for completing tasks; (d) plan the next day; and (e) say out loud Ã¢â‚¬Å“shutdown completeÃ¢â‚¬Â.Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Wean yourself from distractions. Humans are suckers for irrelevancy. We struggle to stay on task.  Fight against distractions.Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Fight against looping (thinking repeatedly about what you already know). To do so, identify the relevant variables, then identify the next step. Consolidate your gains and being the process again.Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Take breaks from focused thinking/work rather than breaks from distraction. Schedule breaks from deep thinking/work. Schedule internet breaks, but keep the times short.Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Email promotes shallow thinking/action. Place out-of-office auto-responder on email during periods of lengthy deep work.Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Establish self-imposed deadlines at the edge of feasibility. This will push you to focus.Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ When walking, record on my phone my thinking regarding deep thinking/work efforts.Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Identify your tech/media use and remove those whose positive outcomes donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t substantially outweigh the negative outcomes.Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Cognitive capacity is limited. Reflect on shallow activities and make wise choices when you must turn away from deep work.Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Limit professional travel as it is disruptive to deep thinking/work.Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Say Ã¢â‚¬Å“noÃ¢â‚¬Â to most all requests that do not align well with your deep tasks.

  Cal Newport makes a convincing argument that ""deep work"" is the key to eudaimonia (""a state at which you're achieving your full human potential"").In our present time of smartphones, social media and constant distraction connection, deep work has become rare.  Those who can focus deeply for periods of time (1-4 hours per day) can be more productive, more valuable and experience deeper satisfaction.In Deep Work, Newport draws attention to some of our seemingly productive habits that are truly just busyness. For example, forwarding an email with an open-ended question, such as: ""Thoughts?"" may take the sender just seconds to write/send, but may take the recipient an hour to sort through and respond if they want to do so thoughtfully.  This is what Newport calls ""busyness as proxy for productivity."" In the absence of clear metrics, people will fall back on what is easiest, and instead focus on being visible.Newport makes some really great arguments for making time in our schedules for deep, focused work.  Do you want to live a life of constant distraction and shallowness or a life of deep focus where you have clarity on what really matters and can accomplish more?  Although I will take the ""Quit Social Media"" chapter with a grain of salt, I do have to agree that deep work is necessary if you want to have a life that is truly rich and meaningful.""I'll live the focused life, because it's the best kind there is.""~ Winifred Gallagher

  I wanted to give this 4 stars because I read about 60 pages and then skimmed the ending and felt like the whole book could be summarized on 1 page that says something to the effect of ""Learn to focus for 4 + hours uninterrupted, otherwise you won't get the extra benefits of industry/immersion.""It follows the new York best seller formula you've all come to know and love of anecdotes/stories/ experimental findings + author's interpretation/experience. Rinse repeat.If you've done any kind of creative or project work where you're in it all the time then this book will just Reinforce what you probably already know.Also don't use social media because it's distracting and turns you into a Muppet with the attention span of an ant. That's not me saying that, that's Me agreeing with Cal Newport saying that.I give this 5 stars because even though for me it's as revolutionary as a 4 star book I think it adequately goes in depth on the topic and presents it in a way that will genuinely help more people achieve deep work.

  Like others have posted, I've been a big fan of Cal's work for a long time. I found his latest book surprisingly shallow with very few insights that jumped out to me as being non-obvious.Cal does an excellent job of building and structuring a logical argument, with a solid evidence base behind everything stated. In particular I loved the concept of scheduling distraction time rather than breaks from distraction, and 'productive meditation'.However these ideas felt like the could have been easily conveyed in a few blog posts, rather than 200+ pages - If you pick up this book you don't need to be convinced that deep work is better than shallow work.Overall, a solid read with a number of good anecdotes and quotes, but a bit light on the big light bulb moments that will change the way I work.

  My assessment of well-written works like, Cal NewportÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Deep Work is the strength of the logic, the value of the thesis and how often I explore the footnotes and go onto to further reading of other authors cited.There is little question of the value of the thesis of Deep Work or the importance of having the skills to quickly master hard things in the Intelligent Machine Age. The logic of achieving these skills, namely the ability to produce high value knowledge work at an elite level is less appreciated but the NewportÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s case for productivity is consistently made throughout Deep Work. The book argument answers not only the Ã¢â‚¬Å“whyÃ¢â‚¬Â but also the Ã¢â‚¬Å“how.Ã¢â‚¬ÂTo better understand the Ã¢â‚¬Å“whyÃ¢â‚¬Â one only needs to read page 27 where Newport  recalls the Ã¢â‚¬Å“bargaining theoryÃ¢â‚¬Â explain why the  Great Restructuring is a particularly good time to have access to capital. The brief excerpt from this page helps us better understand the value and timeliness of his thesisÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Ã¢â‚¬Å“A venture capitalist in todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s economy can fund a company like  Instagram which was eventually sold for a billion dollars while employing  only 13 people. When else in history could such a small amount of labor  be involved in such a large amount of value. With so little input from labor,  the proportion of this wealth that flows back from the machine owners, in  this case, the venture investors, is without precedent.Ã¢â‚¬ÂProfessor NewportÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s book is deserving of five stars, except for the fact that I found confusing the organization of the NOTES section of the book. Nonetheless, I encourage all to carefully read Deep Work, understand the need to develop our knowledge skills, increase our professional productivity and cultivate an intense focus where we place our attention.

  This may not be the quickest read, but it is well worth investing the time and energy to read the book and consider what Newport argues regarding a deep work process something I wanted to learn more about since I engage in knowledge/education work. I like how he lays out the rules of deep work as well as the practicality of going about doing deep work consistently. Perhaps it all comes down to doing it in a way that works for you instead of just mimicking someone elseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s style and process. Learn your process by trial and error. So if you want to improve your knowledge-worker impact, this book might be for you. I know it was impactful for me, and I look forward to applying many of the strategies Newport presented.

  ""Look carefully then how you walk, not as unwise but as wise, making the best use of the time, because the days are evil."" ~ Ephesians 5:15-16Last month, our pastor recommended this book to the rest of the church staff as a resource for using our time well, tuning out the distractions and producing excellent work. The timing was good: I had felt as if my own personal productivity had taken a dip, to the point where the demands on my time were beginning to hurt my family. I was eager to make some changes, and this was definitely the right book at the right time.Cal Newport is certainly no slave to convention. In an era dominated by social media and constant connectivity, he calls for readers to intentionally disconnect more often, pursuing what he calls ""deep work"" free from distraction. But rather than being a ""curmudgeonly pining for the days of unhurried concentration,"" his book pursues ""a pragmatic recognition that the ability to concentrate is a skill that gets valuable things done."" (p 258).Newport describes deep work as: ""Professsional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate."" (p 3)This is contrasted with shallow work: ""Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate."" (p 6)In my review of 2016, I found that most of my time was being spent on the latter at the expense of the former. Judging by the very well-researched findings of Dr. Newport, I'm far from alone, as the data shows that ""deep work"" is increasingly rare in today's economy. But I've never been satisfied with normal. As a believer, I am called to be a good steward of the time, talents, and intellect God gave me. By losing my ability to concentrate deeply and produce excellent work, I was drifting more and more into the sin of laziness, without even noticing.Thankfully Newport provides detailed and practical alternatives for making better choices with my time. The book is split into two sections. The first builds the case for the importance of deep work (it is valuable, rare, and meaningful). The second lists and expounds upon four rules for going deep. The most controversial--for most readers, anyway--is the chapter entitled ""Quit Social Media"" Nowadays we are constantly bombarded with the ubiquity of social media; it is accepted as a given that you must be active on social media (and on other tools of digital connectivity such as e-mail and instant messaging) in order to be a productive member of a digital economy.Newport doesn't mince words in pleading with readers to invest their time in activities which produce value, happiness, and contentment rather than allowing the allure of the Internet to distract us from work and family. And while I may not be totally signing off from all digital media (he acknowledges that this is not feasible or necessary for most people), I have already begun implementing many of his suggestions for planning my time (including planning when I will be accessible through e-mail and social media) more wisely, and have been both more productive and more available to my family in the last two weeks than I have been in some time.If you're like me, and like most other people in the world, you could benefit from learning how to concentrate better, longer, and with greater purpose. This book offers great practical tools which will aid you in your pursuit that goal. While it's not a ""quick fix""--it requires discipline, consistency, and a lot of hard work--it is something which, as I've already seen, can be implemented in relatively short order with almost immediate returns.

  What does it say about the impact of book that touts the value of intense concentration and for the first time in decades you read a complete book (that same book) in one day?  The message is clear: to succeed big in the new knowledge economy, knowledge workers must build the mental muscles to concentrate intensely on meaningful work for extended periods of time.  Although this sounds daunting, the max is typically four hours a day, but it would be four hours of super productive meaningful work.  The key is to find the structure that works for you tp fit in this deep work, and the author provides various options.  Another key is to reduce to a minimum shallow work, things like constant email checking, unnecessary meetings and such.  Newport also recommends a complete disconnect from social media.  He makes a strong case that we are all deluded by the idea that because social media provides any benefit, it is a must in one's life, even thought these benefits may be marginal only.  This book was written pre-pandemic, and the new work-from-home reality will require a re-look at the premises and suggestions, but for the most part, I believe most of the findings and conclusions will remain valid.

  Deep work is professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that pushes your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create a new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate. This book demonstrates why 'going deep' is the best way to live, and how most modern knowledge workers rarely go deep. Newport shows how modern work culture has shifted away from going deep and provides numerous concrete tips on how to get back to it.There is a ton of great information and I would highly recommend this book to just about anyone. Cal Newport is a very clear thinker and is a living example of the success that can be achieved by performing deep work. He shows you the importance of focus and how you can cut a lot of the trivial tasks that are probably consuming a lot of your time. He even mentions the great Arnold Bennett!If you are interested in improving your work or life, this book is a must-read. I am looking forward to reading his other books. Also, his podcast 'Deep Thoughts' is exceptional and if you want a preview of what this book has to offer, download a few episodes. I will be shocked if you do not follow up with purchasing this book and if you do not thoroughly enjoy it.

  Cal Newport's book is the very book I wanted to read in the topic of focused work. I also started to think about such habits in the past couple of years and working from home most of the time I managed to increase my own productivity.The book perfectly summarizes the failures and assumptions most people make nowadays - I always realize this when I ask somebody how many books he has read during last year. (To which the most common answer is zero... or for a luckier person maybe 1 or two). In a distracted world of Youtube, Netflix, and Facebook and your own inbox, finding time to go deep undistractedly takes a deliberate effort.I really appreciate the good tips on how to start minimizing email stress, and interuptions (this is particularly interesting because I am in Sales, so I should pick up the phone and be available for inquiries.) Even so I see how I can implement more of these strategies in my own life. Thank you Cal!

  Other reviewers have already provided an excellent summary of the contents, so I'll jump right to the point.  There were some helpful tips in here, many of which were obvious (avoid social media and email), and some of which were insightful (creating routines to slip into a deep work mindset).  I took enough away to feel that I extracted sufficient value from the purchase, but the author's vantage point coming from the world of academia became tiresome and unrelatable.  His tips for ignoring incoming communications and avoiding shallow work simply aren't possible in the business world where reporting up and working in a matrixed environment with colleagues from different departments are part of your work expectations.  He mitigates this by setting aside blocks of time for addressing shallow work vs. deep work, but depending on your role this may or may not be possible.Overall, there was some good information included in the book, but it was clearly written from an academic perspective and doesn't translate into all business functions particularly well.

  A book on deep work that takes deep work to read. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s OK.  I tackled a chapter a day and fought to practice,deep work while reading. Newport gives a fitting call to return to deep, thoughtful work. While this book may seem like itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s for knowledge workers thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s something here for everyone.Newport starts by laying out the benefits, learning hard stuff fast and performing at high levels. The basic premise is straight forward. You need to minimize distractions to focus on intense and meaningful work. There is more to it but thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a start.Newport lays out plenty of success stories with motivations for deep thought along with some principles and practices to achieve deep work. The principles and practices are varied to fit people in various fields as well as transitioning from shallow to deep work.Rest assured, you will not be told to toss all your devices and cancel all your social media accounts. I read this on my IPad Kindle app. You may chose to toss them anyway but that is not the point. You will be helped with using those things wisely and discover you can survive in the process.Maybe itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time to leave the Shallows for the movie sounds track and dive into deep work.

  Cal Newport's Deep Work is a short but excellent book on how to work in a very focused, productive way.  It is an antidote to ""open offices,"" social media and smartphone distractions, and other factors that have become commonplace the last few years.  It has many good examples and suggestions for focusing and more effective ""Deep Work"" for the reader.Deep Work has a few weaknesses.  Like most self-help books, it uses a lot of exceptional examples -- Theodore Roosevelt did this, Carl Jung did that -- rather than more systematic surveys and data to make its' case.  Although I believe the notion of ""Deep Work"" is mostly valid, it is vaguely defined, a weakness it shares with K Anders Ericsson's ""Deliberate Practice"" (famously popularized by Malcolm Gladwell).

  This book helped me get 2016 started with a bang. After serious procrastination on a number of writings last year--and fruitless writing sessions--I finally embraced the idea explored in Deep Work: producing valuable, creative work requires bouts of intense concentration and keeping one's mind 'clean'. I (1) began dedicating 2 to 4+ hours on mornings to my writing projects, procrastinating instead on the little --less important-- busywork, (2) stopped my daily habit of reading a series of blogs/news, and (3) curtailed my work time to last until 5:30pm, no work afterwards.I made more progress in 3 weeks than in the previous 3 months combined. And I don't even feel that tired. In hindsight, this experience explains why I did well years ago as an engineering undergraduate, in spite of not being a dedicated student: when I did study, I enjoyed the topics and focused intently on understanding the material and solving the problems. Focus pays off.Deep Work offers an overarching theme to organize the working life of a knowledge worker, something missing from the often-quoted GTD methodology (which I use daily). Hard, creative tasks cannot be divided into a 'series of little steps'. Purported as a way to help difficult tasks seem less daunting, breaking down tasks into little pieces instead frustrated me, as I tried to check off to-dos in between reading news. Consuming highly addictive entertainment (Facebook, Twitter, clickbait, etc.) undermines the concentration necessary to produce value. Deep work is highly satisfying, and helps bring in the money.Throughout the book Cal uses peer-reviewed research, articles and anecdotes to back his points, keeping the book both informative and easy to read. A rare 'page-turner' experience on the topic of working effectively.

  I'm a sign business owner and musician, and I bought this book because I'd like to make more of the time I have, I never have enough for my music.  I am always distracted.  I heard about it on NPR, and was intrigued.  I'm about halfway through, and I've already decided that I will probably re-read it in the future, it is wonderfully inspiring.  I enjoy the author's style of writing very much.  It is enjoyable to read, the concepts are very clear, and it is already having a positive effect on my work. I cannot recommend this book highly enough, and I hope that I can all 3 of my teenage girls to read it.  It's the kind of read that is a life-changer.

  I love Cal Newport's work, am a longtime reader of his blog and his previous book, ""So Good They Can't Ignore You"", and this book was no exception. I took copious notes throughout the book and highly recommend it to anyone in a technical field, or in any kind of creative endeavor whatsoever. Even if you think you're not working in a field that requires deep work, think again. Newport's convincing arguments for the value of deep work and its importance in our automation-leaning economy are compelling. Do you think you can't be outsourced or your work mechanized? In the coming years, as other authors have argued (cf. Dan Pink's book, Thinking on The Right Side of the Brain among others), the value of humans as employees will increasingly rely on our ability to come up with creative, deep insights that are still beyond the reach of machine intelligence or low-paid individuals in developing countries. And we will definitely not be paid for reading and responding to our email.Cal Newport shows the way to a better work environment where you are contributing results that can't easily be replicated without you.My only beef with the book, and one that I've struggled with in all of Newport's materials, is that his advice seems particularly suited for people who know what they want to achieve and what goals to set their sights on. It is less helpful for those of us who are ""Renaissance Souls"" (seeÃ‚Â 

  
The Renaissance Soul: How to Make Your Passions Your Life-A Creative and Practical Guide









  
  
    
  ) and wired more like Benjamin Franklin than Mozart. The irony is that even as Cal Newport strongly recommends picking one thing and focusing solely on it, he himself has been extremely successful in both his main focus - his academic career - and his ""side interest"", his business/blog/books. I found little advice on how to bring the concept of Deep Work to bear on multiple pursuits.That caveat aside, the final score is still definitely a 5 star rating. Highly recommended.

  Congratulations for making a New YearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s resolution to do regular physical exercise for weight loss and energy boost.  This is important for you and all those who care about your wellbeing.  However, to improve in your work accomplishments and professional value this year, you must build a different set of muscles:  your ability and commitment to concentrate on focused work.  In our hyper-active world of Internet-intensive temptation to spend time on relatively shallow and low-value activities, this has become exceedingly rare and underappreciated.In his valuable new book, Deep Work:  Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World (Grand Central Publishing 2016), Georgetown Computer Science Professor Cal Newport teaches that the most valuable skill for todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s knowledge workers is the ability to do Ã¢â‚¬Å“activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Those who possess this skill, create new value that is hard to replicate.You know this is true.  Think about the achievers you know Ã¢â‚¬â€œ whether they are entrepreneurs, executives, consultants, attorneys, engineers, physicians, therapists, sales reps, athletes or artists.  The top producers commit to work that requires focused concentration, always carefully working to reduce distractions.But you might not recognize just how difficult it is to do and how addicted you are to relatively shallow activities. In fact, a McKinsey study found that knowledge workers spend on average 60% of their workweek engaged in electronic communications and Internet searches, including 30% of time devoted to reading and answering email alone.  Newport advises that you score your own work behavior on these benchmarks.  He warns, Ã¢â‚¬Å“ubiquitous connectivity generates a devastatingly appealing buffet of distractionsÃ¢â‚¬Â and may be derailing your valuable and meaningful productivity.NewportÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s definition of his term Ã¢â‚¬Å“deep workÃ¢â‚¬Â is instructive:Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that pushes your cognitive capabilities to their limit.  These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.Ã¢â‚¬ÂOne of the fascinating examples of a highly valued deep worker the Newport highlights in his book is Nate Silver, the statistician with an extraordinary record of accurately predicting the outcomes of elections and sports events, who is of particular prominence in 2016 as we enter another year of a presidential election in the United States.At the peak of the last presidential election of 2012, 70% of all traffic to the New York Times website was the blog with SilverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s election forecast, and less than one year later at the young age of 36, ESPN hired him away from the Times to contribute content to a range of programming including sports, news, politics, weather and entertainment.  He knows how to use high-powered statistical software packages to analyze big data sets to generate answers to questions the masses want to know, and, as a result, commands the attention of eyeballs around the world.  SilverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s high-skilled knowledge and proprietary methodology are elite in his field.As a result of deep work, Silver has two abilities that make him uniquely valuable in his field:1. The ability to master hard things;2. The ability to produce at a high level of quality and speed.These two abilities combine for what Newport calls the law of productivity, a formula that guides all top producers:Time spent X Intensity of Focus = High Quality of Work ProducedIn addition to the economic value produced by deep work, Newport devotes a long chapter citing numerous studies in neuroscience, psychology and philosophy and examples to explain how it is a source of meaning and satisfaction.The second part of the book Newport devotes to teaching us how to build the discipline of deep work.  Like physical exercise using weight training and aerobics, all the methods are hard, requiring you to break bad habits and adopt new disciplines.  But also like exercise, the good news is you can select from the many techniques he provides to suit your type of work, your personality and your values; it is not a one-size-fits all recipe.  Here are five of many practical suggestions in the book:1. Manage Email:a. Review daily the subject lines of each email you sent that day.  For each message, ask if it reduced distraction, proactively progressed your primary goals, delegated work where possible.b. Batch email reading and writing at specific times of day, and no more, resisting the temptation to view messages as they arrive.c. Discriminate about who and how you distribute your email address and be clear about the subjects that will get your attention.d. Ignore messages that will get you mired in unproductive communications.e. Write carefully thinking about the response you need and considering the limited time of others.2. Meditate on Productivitya. Devote time to think about a single problem or challenge during exercise and commute times.b. Be mindful of your focus throughout the workday.c. Imagine you have no connectivity at several times of your day.  Ask what you could/should do with time when you have no connectivity, like during time on an airplane.d. Focus on completing work you know is valuable, rather than just getting things done and crossing them off your to-do list.3. Schedule Every Minute of Every Daya. End your workday at a specific time because our capacity for deep work is limited.4. Conduct Cost/Benefit Analyses of Activitiesa. Quantify the depth of each activity in terms of advancing your goalsb. Say Ã¢â‚¬Å“noÃ¢â‚¬Â to activities that will not produce desirable outputc. Adjust or modify your work environment, whether you have complete control or inherit certain conditions created by your employer (such as the open floor plan championed by Facebook).5. Develop and Follow a Training Regimen to Build Concentration Musclesa. Read books instead of blogs, increasing protein intake and reducing carbs.b. Exercise your mind and memory to strengthen your ability to concentrate intensely.c. Make regular time for developing a new skill, like learning to dance, learning a foreign language, playing bridge or chess.Deep Work contains many more suggestions of how you can train your ability to concentrate and produce quality work that is valued.  I strongly suggest you read it and set up your program to exercise your work muscles.  Just as you trim your body fat with physical exercise, your new discipline will increase your professional productivity dramatically.

  Cal Newport's ""Deep Work"" is a challenging and convicting read on our culture's inability to produce work that matters. According to Newport, as we shifted from a material economy to a knowledge economy, we began to increasingly rely services (email, Twitter, Slack, etc) that actually undermine our capability to do knowledge work well. Newport's solution is something he calls ""Deep Work,"" or ""professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit.""Parts of ""Deep Work"" are incredibly insightful and applicable. The chapter on our over glorification of ""unstructured free time"" and how its led to more work/life dissatisfaction was fascinating. Also, I've incorporated some of Newport's suggestions into my professional life (thankfully, I work in an environment conducive to Deep Work). However, other parts of ""Deep Work"" are incredibly dry and repetitive. At times, I felt that this book would've been better as a series of essays.There is a ton of valuable information in ""Deep Work"" and I found much of it very helpful, but I did glaze over more than a few times as I made my way through it (which, who knows, may actually prove Newport's hypothesis).

  I have a love/hate relationship with this book. I think I will forever feel guilty whenever I give in and partake in some of the shallow activities that the author specifically names as being time-wasters (and rightfully so). I love this book because it really was a bit like a smack in the face to wake up and notice where I was wasting time. Although it will take me much time to be able to do deep work like I would like to and like was described in the book, I have already found myself resisting the temptation to pull out my phone or check email when I get bored or stuck with a piece of work. I work for myself so there really is no one else but me to keep me on track. I took copious notes throughout the book and I will be reviewing them often but I really wish the author was accessible for questions. He seems to be the opposite of one of my favorite authors - Adam Grant. There is really no way to contact the author and even if you did,  it seems unlikely that he would answer you. He states that he can help more people by doing deep work and putting out more research and not wasting time responding to emails, etc. I have a few questions I would love to have answered but I really can't see anyway to do that. (In case you are reading this Mr. Newport, is it acceptable to lump together a bunch of shallow activities, like responding to emails, texting, watching the news and writing Amazon book reviews - exactly what I am doing now - all at the same time since none of them require deep work? Tomorrow will be the end of my first week trying to follow many of the book's suggestions for deep work and although it has been difficult, I am pleased with my progress and the quantity of high quality work I have been able to produce. I recommend this book to everyone!

  This book has a good thesis and ably lays out research about and examples of people who have learned various methods and approaches of intense focus that produces great results. Much of the material is not new, but it's a good primer on the subject. Sometimes I thought the writer seemed a bit narrow in his outlook and had a weak understanding of differing character types and psychological frames. Overall I'm pleased to have read it and will go back to it, I'm sure.

  Even though he has valid points, how practical is he in the real world. Cal is no doubt a smart guy, but he has always worked in academia and not in the corporate world. He must also have a wife at home that does all the housework, bills and child rearing while he can do his focused work Ã¢â‚¬Å“that is more importantÃ¢â‚¬Â in the real world. Why does he use women in the cases of Ã¢â‚¬Å“what not to do?Ã¢â‚¬Â

  ""You don't need a rarified job; you need instead, a rarified approach to your work.""~ Pg. 91In a compelling yet friendly voice, Cal Newport advises the readers to understand where the core of his/her work priority should lay, in committing to shallow work that s/he is made to believe should matter, or towards the deep work, which is the reason why s/he has committed to this profession at the first place.This book is an antidote to the mentality of the hustle culture that contemporary professional life touts as a key to success.Newport's point: Shallow work won't take you to the same place where deep work will; so choose sensibly.

  Many times through reading this book I said to myself ""get to the point."" You can tell the author went to great lengths to piece this project together. Yet I feel like this whole book was probably only worthy of a blog post.* Establish priority ""must get this ish done"" tasks of your job, business, project, or study.* Prioritize the list by most important to least important* Create a timer for yourself; let's say 90m* Focus solely on that task uninterrupted until the timer stops, take a break* Repeat process until the task is complete.* Move onto the next item within your priority list.* Repeat process until all tasks are complete.

  I have long lamented that the industrial scientist of today (thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s me) is swamped by so much non scientific stuff in his or her day that doing the actual science that they were ostensibly hired for is next to impossible.  A never ending tidal wave of e-mails, a calendar peppered with  meetings and constant interruption from inter office instant communication (Slack and the like) put the mind in a continual distracted state that prevents the deep thought needed for scientific discovery.  The irony is that we tend to laud and promote scientists who embrace this Ã¢â‚¬â„¢shallowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ work even though they must abandon their commitment to scientific discovery to do so.  Those of us who resist this (yep, me again) tend to be viewed as behind the times curmudgeons that canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t cope with the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœculture of connectivityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.I was thrilled to find that a bright and young computer science professor at Georgetown University feels much the same as I do and took the time to write a book about it.  The author defines Ã¢â‚¬Ëœdeep workÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ as professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.The book Ã¢â‚¬Å“Deep WorkÃ¢â‚¬Â is divided into two parts.  The first attempts to support the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Deep Work HypothesisÃ¢â‚¬Â,  which asserts:  The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.The second half of the book attempts to supply techniques for maximizing such deep work in your daily schedule.I found the first part of the book to be very  insightful and an excellent defense of ideas that I have long felt myself but ineffectively communicated or defended.  I feel validated and more determined to ensure I am doing the deep work that will make the most of my ability, education and talent to deliver great value to the company that I work for.  The second half of the book fell a bit flat for me.  This may be due to the fact that over the years I have already developed many of my own strategies for securing time for deep work.  But the advice and suggestions in the second half of the book may be quite valuable for others.Altogether, I highly recommend the book to knowledge workers struggling to find the uninterrupted time to do the high impact and high value Ã¢â‚¬Ëœdeep workÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ they were hired for.

  As I read Deep Work, I felt both spurred on to continue in my own work, and to adopt a number of effective suggestions the author makes.  Although he at one point makes a staunch stand against social media, essentially saying that because it is distracting and (very debatably) unnecessary, that we should eliminate it, I think he has a point.  One of his major theses in the book is just that: be mindful of the the way you use your time, especially while using electronics, and remove all unnecessary or detrimental distraction in your life if you want to prioritize your life's work.I highly recommend this book to writers, artists, and people struggling to manage their social media use, or fit time into a busy schedule for personal projects.  In an age of noise, instant gratification, and an expectation of immediate availability, this book thankfully pushes back.  It reminds us that work of depth and quality, and a life well-lived and thought out, are sacred.  They also are essential for your success in rapidly changing knowledge economy.

  I read this book in an attempt to help mentally prepare for a rigorous graduate program that I will be starting soon. Overall I found it helpful to get in the right mindset and do think that I took away some helpful pieces of advice, but frankly itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nothing that I couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have told myself. It is more of a helpful booster to motivate you to actually take the steps necessary to obtain a high degree of focus and concentration in a world that so desperately tries to distract us from this type of cognitive practice. I will say I wish there were more references to female figures and less to men... but would still recommend if looking to get in the right mindset or change your daily habits.

As a result, of applying these strategies, I was able to get more done in the second week of January than I did in 2 weeks in December and I thought I was being very focused back in December.Thank you, Cal, for all you work and an enormous impact onÃ¢â‚¬â€¹ my and my client's success in school and career.

  The ability to concentrate is an act of deep work. The ability to concentrate is necessary to learn and to push yourself and your career forward. The ability to concentrate is, also, a skill that must be trained -- we mislead ourselves into thinking that it's just a skill we ""turn on"" when conditions are right; alas, that's not how it works.Doing deep work requires a lot of preparation, practice, strength, and follow through. For example, are the things you working the right things? Do you prioritize, schedule, and protect your ability to deep work in the face of endless distractions - e.g. meetings, email threads, social media, etc? And how do you manage all this while balancing the need to stay responsive to your colleagues, family, and friends?This book is full of gems. There are dozens of insights and compelling arguments for why you should prioritize deep work. Similarly, there is a lot of practical advice on how to structure your days to do deep work - e.g. routines, rules, scheduling tips, and other tricks to get you on the way.Inspiring, motivational, and full of hands-on tips. In short, a must read if you want to get ahead.

  Cal Newport's work is essential to understand in a world becoming continually distracted. He explains a way of life that usually only writers, philosophers, and artists are familiar with. In doing so, he extracts that way of life unfamiliar to most and makes it accessible for everyone. This is the practice of deep work. The practice of deep work will help anyone manage their time better and drain the shallows of distractive habits that the mind becomes accustomed to, constantly checking email or social media, for example. Deep work ultimately is a lifestyle design philosophy that works for people who are especially creative. Yet I don't think that deep work is just for ""knowledge workers"" as Cal postulates. I feel it is for everyone. I believe athletes, artists, and people with ordinary jobs will benefit from this book. Essential reading for anyone in the modern world.

  The reading is compelling, instructional, and practical.  I couldn’t put Digital Minimalism down, and ended up ""consuming” it in only 4 sits.  Because of that, I feel compelled to share a review before you make any commitment.Let me divide this review into 3 parts.  First I'll share reasons why I chose to read the book and some personal takeaways.  Next, a summary of the book including short excerpts I highlighted while taking notes.  Last, I'll suggest a few complementary readings.PERSONAL THOUGHTSI probably pre-ordered this book because I’ve been intrigued by how the overused of modern technologies—specially social networks and social media—have influenced our societies during the last 10 years.  This latest wave is actually recent, and being in my early 30s I still remember clearly how life was during high school and early days in college before this explosion.We all acknowledge the wonders of technology, how the development of new tools has helped the prosperity of our societies in many dimensions.  However, the opposite is equally important—consequences that deserve to be understood and evaluated.  Besides the social, emotional and psychological aspects, which are the main focus of Digital Minimalism, I also care about the impacts on our physical health caused by technology overexposure.  Not only how the devices shape our physical posture for worst over the years but also the detrimental effects of electromagnetic fields to our overall health.That said, I’ve been trying to be mindful about technology use during the last 4-5 years.  I still have social network accounts, but I feel quite odd among my peers because I’ve been checking these accounts less often than ever—about once a month—but I rarely post pictures or comments.  It brings a deep sense of freedom and calmness.  In terms of smartphone use, I keep it on airplane mode for around 80% of the awake time, and I often try to go on adventures up in the mountains to be away from signal access for days or weeks at a time.  This desire to be unreachable has grown over time and, although it makes me feel grounded and present, I admit that can be quite selfish of me towards loved ones.Reading this book helped me better understand the forces behind addictive technologies, exposed me to pragmatic ideas to implement the minimalism philosophy, and supported my previous thoughts on how we can better handle digital overexposure.SUMMARY[Intro]  Digital minimalism, according to Cal Newport, is a philosophy where we focus our online time on a small number of carefully selected and optimized activities that support the things we value.  We learn how the author got interested in the topic after receiving feedbacks from his previous book.[Chapter 1]  Cal starts with a refresher—bringing back to the early and “potentially innocent"" days of Facebook and the iPhone—then, he soon shows how these new technologies took the lead by dictating how we behave and how we feel by pushing us to overuse their products for as long as possible.  Interesting story about how NYU professor Adam Alter shifted his research topic after getting “trapped” for 6 uninterrupted hours playing a game on his phone during a cross-country flight.  Cal then explains 2 of the main forces used by technology companies to encourage behavior addiction: [1] Intermittent positive reinforcement.  [2] The drive for social approval.[Chapter 2]  Here is a primer on digital minimalism.  We learn that ""to reestablish control, we need to move beyond tweaks and instead rebuild our relationship with technology from scratch, using our deeply held values as a foundation.”  Cal explains why digital minimalism works through 3 principles:  [1] The first principle argues that, when we clutter our time and attention with many apps, social networks, and services, we create an overall negative cost compared to the benefits of each individual item in isolation.  I was absolutely delighted to read his arguments by sharing Henry Thoreau’s decision to live for two years in a cabin near the Walden Pond.  Thoreau's book, Walden, has actually impacted my life tremendously when I first read as a freshmen in college.  [2] The second principle says that besides choosing a technology that supports our values, we should also think how we should use them to extract full benefits—optimizing, therefore, the returns.  Here Cal shows how “the law of diminishing returns” can be directly correlated with potential negative effects when technology usage surpass the benefits they can generate.  [3] The last principle shows that being more intentional about how we engage with new technologies is one way to become sincerely satisfied.  For that, the author illustrates the Amish's approach toward technology: “they start with the things they value most, then work backward to ask whether a given new technology performs more harm than good with respect to their values.”[Chapter 3]  In this chapter Cal shares a system for digital decluttering by transforming our relationship with technology.  He encourages us to apply a rapid transformation:  “something that occurs in a short period of time and is executed with enough conviction that the results are likely to stick.”  He divides the process in 3 steps:  [1] The first one is to establish which ones of the new “optional” technologies we can step away from without creating major problems in either our professional or personal life.  [2] The second step is to take the leap and give ourselves a 30-day break while we rediscover the activities that generate real satisfaction without being attached to our devices.  [3] The final step is the reintroduction, building it from the scratch, following the principles previously explained in chapter 2 by choosing carefully the apps/tools and using them with a deeper sense of purpose.[Chapter 4]  This is most probably my favorite chapter, where we learn the value of solitude.  Cal starts by sharing an interesting story of President Lincoln’s decision to reside in a cottage during months at time, communicating back and forth to the White House on horseback.  The author then shares the benefits of solitude such as being a prerequisite for original and creative thoughts, as well as a deeper appreciation for interpersonal connections when they occur.  He then shifts gears toward the impacts of solitude depravation, showing, for example, that the rise in anxiety-related problems among students coincide with the use of smartphones and social media.  At the end of the chapter we learn 3 practices to foster more solitude moments in our daily lives:  [1] To leave our phones and devices at home.  [2] To go on long walks.  [3] To spend time journaling.[Chapter 5]  Now we jump to a chapter rich in social psychology lessons.  We first learn how our brains evolved to desire social interactions, but differently than the rich face-to-face encounters, during the last decade or so we have been bombarded by digital communication tools, encouraging interactions through short, text-based messages and approval clicks.  At the end Cal offers practices to develop meaningful “conversation-centric communication.”  They range from avoiding clicking the “like” button all the way to holding more meaningful conversations during office hours.[Chapter 6]  Now we jump to an empowering chapter.  We learn to cultivate high-quality leisure time at the same time we declutter the low-quality digital distractions from our lives.  They both, in fact, work together in order to create a more purposeful habit.  This chapter is filled with real life examples of successful stories where helpful lessons are drawn at the end of each example.  Like in the previous chapters, Cal doesn’t share only examples, but also practical ways to adopt his claims.  My favorite suggestion is about scheduling in advance the time we'll be spending on low-quality leisure.[Chapter 7]  The final chapter is about building a more resistant mindset to avoid the power of the attention economy—which is “business sector that makes money gathering consumers' attention and then repacking and selling it to advertisers.""  Practices are provided when further discipline is required to avoid exploitation:  [1] Delete social media from our phone to remove the ability to access them at any time.  If we're going to use social medial, we should access them through a web browser.  [2] Turn our devices into purposeful tools, diminishing the number of things they enable us to do.  In Cal's own words “I’m not talking about occasionally blocking some sites when working on a particularly hard project.  I want you instead to think about these services as being blocked by default, and made available to you on an intentional schedule.”  [3] To use social media like a social media professional does.  [4] To embrace the slow media consumption by maximizing the quality of what we consume.  [5] Making the hard choice to switch from smartphone to a “dumb” phone.COMPLEMENTARY READINGSWell, it doesn’t matter where in the spectrum we fall as long as we vow to move the needle towards a more meaningful and intentional technology use, diminishing our “natural” tendency to become dependent on digital devices.  While reading Digital Minimalism I thought about book titles that could complement the content.[1] Essentialism, by Greg McKeown, is definitely the one that comes to mind first.  It helped me focus on less but more important tasks, giving clarity to what matters most.[2] Originals, by Adam Grant, helped me see the world of creativity through a different angle by being more true to who I'm.[3] Atomic Habits, by James Clear, has already influenced me to build better and more meaningful habits during the last 3 months.  It can be an extremely helpful source to apply the lessons suggested in Chapter 6.[4] Last, if you'd like to learn a bit more about electromagnetic fields and how we can minimize the dangers, look no further than The Non-Tinfoil Guide to EMFs, by Nicolas Pineault.Take good care,Haical

  If you already want to curb the role of digital stuff in your life, you won't get that much value out of this book.Cal makes a great case for WHY to pursue digital minimalism. But I already know why -- my digital addictions are messing up my life. What I wanted to know is HOW.On that, Cal doesn't have as much to say. A few tips -- mostly the ""digital declutter,"" a 30-day moratorium on the digital services in your life -- are pretty useful. For one, it finally convinced me to buy Freedom, an app that regulates your internet use.The rest of the book is thickly padded with anecdotes. They had me flipping pages, wishing we could get to the point.$15 can either get you this book, or half of a year of Freedom. If I could roll back the clock I know where I'd put my money.

  After reading Newport's book, Deep Work, earlier this year, I eagerly pre-ordered Digital Minimalism. I found Deep Work to be profound, thought-provoking, and somewhat life-changing.With Digital Minimalism, I just want my time and money back. In this book, Newport explores a ""new"" idea (it's not) that social media use and technology are hurting us in ways we did not expect and that digital minimalism(!) is the answer. He had thousands of his blog readers experiment with a 1-month technology sabbath/abstinence and reported their findings because he himself has never used social media (e.g., never joined Facebook). I found it odd for someone like Newport to talk as if he knew the experiences and difficulties of technology addiction when he himself has never felt the helpless compulsion to check their smartphone when bored as most people are today. It's like someone who's never been overweight providing thoughts, practices, and strategies to a fat person on losing weight to -- it sort of just rings hollow. He poorly defends himself by saying that because he's not fallen trap to modern technologies, he has experience of seeing things from the other side.The rest of the book is mostly things you probably already know or common sense stuff about technology addiction. There are a few useful tips on how to combat our overuse of technology, which is why I've given the book 2 stars instead of 1.I would not recommend this book; for ~$15 and only 250 pages of fluff, your money is better spent elsewhere.

  Cal Newport is one of my favorite thinkers. He got his Ph.D. in Computer Science from MIT and is now a Professor at Georgetown. He’s also a bestselling author of a number of books including one of my top all-time favorites: Deep Work.Given the fact that the fastest way to Optimize your life is to STOP doing things that are sub-optimal AND the fact that (for nearly all of us) our use of technology is the #1 thing that “Needs work!,” I think it’s SUPER important for us to figure out how to best use all the technology available to us WITHOUT becoming lost in a tsunami of inputs.Enter: Our new philosophy of technology use: Digital Minimalism.Enter: My strong recommendation of the book.If you’ve been looking for a coherent approach on how to, as per the sub-title of the book, Choose a Focused Life in a Noisy World, I think you’ll love Digital Minimalism as much as I did.

  Some articles should become books while some books should remain blog posts. This book is an example of the latter.I was riveted by Newport’s previous book, Deep Work, having reread it several times. I was captivated by Newport’s TEDx talk about leaving social media. After reading Newport’s blog posts on Digital Minimalism in late 2017 and having followed several general minimalism blogs for the last few years (e.g. Joshua Becker), I had high hopes for this book after first hearing about it several months before its release. Honestly, I do not know what I was expecting from this book, but I did not find “it” in Newport’s latest release.The book contains much helpful background information about the digital “slot machines” we carry in our pockets and yearning for repeated dopamine hits. The case was well made for the problem at hand. The book fell short in solutions. For every solution proposed, several pages of background and anectodatal stories/case studies were presented. The examples were weak and unmoving. While the solutions presented were solid overall, they did not need to be stretched out over several pages to fill pages in a book. As stated previously, this book felt forced as it would have been adequate as a series of blog posts or long form article. Like the minimalism movement overall, there is not much left to say on this topic which has not already been said repeatedly online through many voices.While Newport has managed to avoid the trappings of social media, it seems like he was lured into the publisher’s net to create another best seller. Unfortunately, Digital Minimalism does not deliver.

  This is a great and very readable book that'll probably change how you relate to social media and your phone.  You should read it ASAP and I'll be recommending it to everyone I know.Unlike a lot of authors, Cal Newport actually walks the walk too.  You don't get tenure at Georgetown AND write a couple bestselling books (with kids) unless you really have your act together.But ... I had two issues with the book.  (1) it wasn't organized as well as it could have been, and (2) it contradicted itself in minor ways.  The biggest example of the latter is when, early on, Newport bashes on the tips/tricks/hacks (""turn off notifications"") that are occasionally recommended to people trying to spend less time with their phone, before later giving many similar tips and tricks (good ones to be sure) himself.The book also has a sort of weird structure -- I figured Part 1 would be the philosophy of it all, where Part 2 would be the implementation, but instead you get the philosophy + the details of the ""30 Day Declutter"" (which Newport has talked about in interviews leading up to the book) in Part 1, then a detour discussion of leisure, then back to some very good points about the economics of attention + social media to wrap things up.It's all very good, and like I said, you should definitely read it (I could see myself reading it multiple times), but reluctantly I'd say those two things are enough to dock a star.

  Being a huge fan of the author's superb book ""Deep Work"" (easily one of the most important books I've ever read), I came to Digital Minimalism expecting some good stuff.  And it delivered.  Really well done and highly recommended.I really only had one complaint with the book — that the author felt it somehow incumbent upon him to include a case study near the very end in which some professor named Jennifer ""prefers to be addressed as 'they / them.'""  And while you could see he made every effort to refer to Jennifer as Jennifer, here and there the awkward ""they"" or ""them"" or ""their"" had to be shoehorned into a sentence to fit this person's kooky gender politics.  And the thing is, the author could have chosen any of 1,000 other similar case studies to make exactly the same points.  There was NOTHING unique about Jennifer that would make her (er, them?!) a vital inclusion in the book.  Which makes me think she (er, they?!) were added for no other reason than to tip a hat to the contemporary gender idiocy going on today.Anyhow.  Otherwise, the book was fantastic.  And it really is quite important.  I bought it as a book AND on Audible, though when it came to that stupid section with Jennifer I had to fast forward through it on Audible because I couldn't stomach listening to all the weird ""they"" and ""them"" references.

  THE PROBLEM: We've got these gizmos and gadgets that allow us to do lots of cool, often useful things, like sending messages, checking maps and traffic, seeing baby niece photos, and watching supremely educational cat videos. At the same time, those gizmos are designed to be addictive, taking us away from more important things, e.g. that real life thing.THE SOLUTION: Reclaim your life by instituting a policy of principled use. How and when do I use the gizmos, and why? How can they add to my life without subtracting from it?Newport proposes a Digital Declutter: step away from optional online activities for 30 days, then ""add back a small number of carefully chosen online activities that you believe will provide massive benefit to these things you value."" 1600 of his readers who volunteered to do it got a stupendous amount out of the exercise.Newport is a deep thinker; ""So Good They Can't Ignore You"" & ""Deep Work"" were game-changers for me. I'll be taking many of this book's suggestions to heart: more solitude, more walks, more letters to myself, consolidated texting, conversation office hours, and no more clicking 'Like' or social media commenting. Implementing this book's advice will significantly enrich your life.-- Ali Binazir, M.D., M.Phil., Happiness Engineer and author of

  I bought Digital Minimalism: Choosing A Focused Life in A Noisy World by Cal Newport because I liked his last book, Deep Work. Newport is on the Computer Science faculty at Georgetown University. He studies and writes about the impact of technology on society. Cal Newport does not have, and never has had, a social media account. Digital Minimalism is about living and working in a world where the rest of us have several accounts and use them all the timeThe book has two parts. Part one has three chapters. The first chapter is “A Lopsided Arms Race."" It's about how social media companies manipulate our attention so they can make more money. There's a lot of good information and analysis, even if the chapter seems like ""Chicken Little.""Chapter two is “The Philosophy of Digital Minimalism.” According to Newport, there are three principles of digital minimalism. the first principle is that clutter is costly. Principle two is that optimization is important. Principle three is that intentionality is satisfying. Newport tells us that these principles are “self-evident.” Then he devotes several pages to arguments for them.Chapter three is “The Digital Declutter.” It’s written to help you move from being the helpless pawn of digital media to someone in control of their own life. Newport assumes that everyone has many digital media feeds and that we spend far too much time checking our feeds and posting on them. He never explicitly states this assumption and never supports it. What he describes is not true for most of the people I know. Most of them use only one, or two media. They use their feed(s) for a specific purpose. I’m around young people like the people Newport describes. Could their usage pattern be the temporary result of coming of age in a world where there is so much social media?Part two of the book is about practices. The first chapter, “Spend Time Alone,” is excellent. If you start the book and decide it’s not for you, skip ahead and read chapter four before you quit for good. Newport describes the effects of digital social networks on people born after 1995.  It's very scary and deserves more than part of a chapter.  Chapter five is about how to use social media. Newport uses the phrase, “When used properly,” which seems to shift blame to the user. Chapter five also contains an excellent analysis of the experimental designs for some of the research about how people use digital media and what the consequences are.Chapter six helps us “Reclaim Leisure.” The leisure that Newport wants us to reclaim is mostly about doing things with our hands. Newport suggests that we should become “handy.” I would rather spend time studying the history of art (a current passion) or taking my grandson to a museum. I wish there had been more on other forms of leisure, like learning to tango, hiking the trails in a local park, or family dinners.  Finally, we come to chapter seven, “Join the Attention Resistance.” Newport comes full-circle to the evil, manipulative digital media. If you want to resist them, you’ll find ideas here about what you can do. If you’re more concerned about how digital media fits into a life well-lived for you or the people you love, you can skip this chapter. In A NutshellDigital Minimalism is a very uneven book. Some parts are very, very good. Other spots seem like they were dashed off to increase the page count., I would buy this book for the first chapter on a lopsided arms race, chapter four on solitude, and the material in chapter five analyzing experimental designs.Cal Newport could have written a book about the impact of digital media and other forces on people born after 1995. He could have written a book about how to integrate social media into a life well lived. Instead, he wrote Digital Minimalism. That’s our loss.

  Good god this book is awful. The writer has never used social media and is barely online, yet still feels that they’re qualified to give advice to those of us trying to lessen our attachment to the digital world. Every sentence came off grossly over-simplified, completely unaware, and more than a little bit smug. I couldn’t finish it, so I added it to the little free library near our home. Maybe it will be someone else’s cup of tea.

  This an example of a book that should at best be an essay or a short TED talk, some rules and principles designed to 'declutter' the technology from your life. It includes an ad nauseum list of individuals who have contacted the author, illustrating the impact of technology on their lives, and the steps they've taken to the distracting, draining, addictive impact of Apps and smart phones and the Internet on modern life. In my mind, this an example where a pre-high tech cultural item, a book, was a waste of my time in the Age of Technology.

  Folks, read Digital Minimalism. You (and I) are more addicted to social media and our smart phones than we would care to admit. (or worse, know that we should admit)  This is a practical book on how we can break our digital addictions and what you can replace the time with - real conversations, craft work, leisure time, rest.I am a huge fan of Deep Work where Cal taught us:  ""A deep life is a good life."" If you've read that book, you'll recall he had an entire chapter titled ""Quit Social Media."" That was a provocative chapter for me to read.  I disagreed with Cal when I first read it.  But over time the importance of that chapter has sunk in and now call has written Digital Minimalism to give us more of ""why"" we should declutter our digital lives and also ""how"" to do so.Digital Minimalism has 7 very readable chapters split into two main parts: Foundations and Practices. Cal does a great job for building the case of how social media and apps are crafted to steal as much of our time as we'll give it.  Or, as Bill Maher is quoted in the book they can ""steal your soul.""  Powerful statement to consider. Bill makes the point as quoted in this book that social media tycoons are like ""tobacco farmers in T-shirts.""  They know that their social media is addictive.While Cal does a great job in this book for building the case on how addictive and problematic social media and smart phone apps can be, what I really like about this book is that he describes several practical tools about what we could actually do with our time that would be so much more fulfilling,  (Hence, Deep Work 2.0)My favorite chapter is titled ""Spend Time Alone"" where Cal uses the example of President Abraham Lincoln getting away to a retreat near Washington D.C. during the Civil War to spend time alone and to think through the country's problems and solutions. Cal advocates for the importance of time for each of us to simply think. Not do. Not check our phones. But think.  Cal notes that many of us have almost no alone time and almost no time to simply just be, do and think.I appreciate how Cal weaves in Thoreau and Wendell Barry and their views on a deep life or a simple life being the good life. This book just does such a nice job of clearly explaining the challenges, distractions and addictions of our modern digital age and how we can redirect time spent on digital pursuits toward a meaningful life.If you are a fan of Cal's previous epic book, Deep Work, you'll love Digital Minimalism. If you haven't read Deep Work yet, do it.  It transformed my work habits away from ""shallow work.""  And then read Digital Minimalism too for sure!  Actually, you can read Digital Minimalism first, but then don't miss out on deep work.Okay , signing off my computer now to go spend time with my family! :)Mike Pritchard

  As is always the case, I really enjoyed Cal Newport's writing in his new work.  I'm a bit biased in that I read his original yellow book (How to Win at College) almost ten years ago upon beginning college, and I know it played a big part in my success in college and in my professional life.  I've kept up with Cal's writing via his blog ever since, but I hadn't pulled the trigger on any of his other books until now.  I pre-ordered this book because I couldn't wait to read Cal's book-length treatise on the matter.Cal's philosophy on technology use has always been spot on, which is all the more surprising given his background as an MIT-educated computer science professor.  Digital Minimalism was everything I expected it to be, and I can't recommend it enough.  It is a book that everyone should read, as it really helps to put our current excessive technology use into perspective.  Sadly, most of those reading Digital Minimalism are likely the choir; those who most need to hear Cal's advice will be so caught up in their digital distraction that they will never encounter the book.My favorite thing about the book is that Cal's advice is immensely practical.  He is no Luddite, and he does not expect you to eliminate technology from your life.  In fact, he urges you to embrace technology when it strongly supports the things you value most in life.  He does not argue for or against any specific technology, but instead urges us to closely scrutinize any new technology before allowing it to enter our life.  We should stop viewing new technology through the prism of what we are missing out on, and instead evaluate new technology based on how it supports our core goals and, specifically, whether the new technology is the BEST way to support our goals.  If a new technology is deemed to be the best way to support our goals, Cal then recommends that we carefully tailor our use of the technology to get the most benefit while minimizing the concomitant distractions.  This is where Cal's practical advice shines.  For instance, instead of instituting a blanket ban on social media (like his detractors might expect him to do), Cal suggests that those who use social media limit their use to their computer or tablet (i.e., no iPhone social media unless absolutely necessary!) in order to eliminate boredom browsing, and also to tailor their settings for the social media application to ensure that the app is serving the user and not the other way around.  Although I share Cal's disdain for social media and abstain from it entirely, I definitely understand that total abstinence may not be feasible for some people, and I feel that his advice is the most common sense approach that I have come across.I found myself agreeing with almost everything Cal says in the book, but I do have two minor critiques.  First, toward the end of the book, Cal discusses the emergence of app-blocking software and ""Dumb Phones"", and seemingly recommends that we adopt these paternalistic mechanisms to prevent us from being trapped by the allure of new technology.  Cal's praise for these things weakens the strength of his arguments for the Digital Minimalism philosophy, as it suggests that we are doomed to be sucked into the new technology vortex and that the only way to avoid this outcome is to take drastic measures that will literally not allow us the freedom to make our own choices about technology.  I believe Cal's cheerleading of these app-blockers and ""Dumb Phones"" is short-sighted, as the practices outlined in Digital Minimalism should allow us the strong will to avoid these technological temptations.  Also, it needs to be said that introducing these things into your technological mix could actually cause additional distraction; think of how much time you might waste trying to program your browser blocker to prevent yourself from visiting a certain mix of ever-changing sites at various points in the day and week.  How much time will we waste researching the best ""Dumb Phone"" and constantly switching back and forth between it and our regular iPhone?  Is it worth all the trouble?  Tellingly, at the end of the section Cal seemingly admits that he just sticks with an iPhone, as it is not enough of a distraction for him to have to add the extra hassle of a ""Dumb Phone.""  I think this should be the advice for all of us, as unless we put ourselves in some sort of bubble, there will always be unavoidable digital temptations out there that will require a strong backbone (and Digital Minimalist mindset) to resist.My second criticism is that Cal's advice on how to spend your free time is a bit muddled.  On one hand, he strongly stresses the importance of ample amounts of solitude, which he describes as ""a subjective state in which your mind is free from input from other minds.""  Yet he also stresses the importance of prioritizing demanding activities that often require strained mental effort.  He references Arnold Bennett, who recommended reading difficult literature and poetry for leisure.  To be fair, Cal does caution against taking Bennett's list of prescribed activities too literally, but he seems to endorse Bennett's philosophy of engaging in mentally demanding leisure pursuits that don't fit his definition of solitude.  There seems to be a bit of conflict between the recommendation of Thoreau-esque solitude, whereby one might spend his/her time building a cabin or doing simple manual labor, and the recommendation of mentally demanding leisure activities such as reading dense writing.  I think that it is likely that both of these types of activities are important, but Cal never really distinguishes between the two nor provides a discussion of how much of each we might need.These two critiques are minor, and really should be viewed more as topics that I hope Cal will address in his future writings as opposed to outright criticisms.  I'm a huge fan of Cal and his writing, and I look forward to continuing to learn from him in the future.  In conclusion, I strongly recommend that you pick up a copy of Digital Minimalism, and perhaps pick up an extra copy to gift to that person in your life who never looks up from their phone.  Digital Minimalism is an important, timely work that we can all benefit from.

  I like that the author cites data and tells stories, and that he gets concrete about what to do. Obviously no one could write a book that speaks to every possible relationship a user might have with their technology. However, I feel like the target audience here is educated white people who not only can buy smartphones but can also choose from whatever hobbies or activities they desire. I was picturing all the poverty-stricken folks out there who somehow manage to have a smartphone. Their lives may be just as hijacked by technology as the aforementioned white folks (perhaps more?) but they have less options for dealing with it.I’d also like to suggest, because it would be fun, the addition of a survey that evaluates one’s “addiction” to technology. As I tried to suss out my own level of addiction, I immediately went into denial. Does the addict readily admit his addiction? In truth, I barely touch Facebook, don’t use Twitter at all, and only use Instagram for family pics. But I did immediately stop playing the one game I play! I guess that one change made it worth reading the book!

  I know i should know better by this point but I keep buying books like this one.  If you haven't read anything about how social media affects our lives negatively, then the first part of this could be interesting.  If, like me, you have read a fair amount about the subject, there isn't anything new.  Even the scattered tips for minimizing digital interaction aren't anything new.  I stayed interested for the first third of the book, so I have to give the author credit there.  His writing was engaging, even if I was reading the same old stuff.  It seems that one less studied side effect of our digitally-intensive lifestyles is the fact that it has created a market for books like this that could have been one third of the length.  Maybe someone should write an overlong book about that.

  Having transforming my home (and life) in the past years with minimalism, this book title really caught my eye as I have also been itching to clear up the digital clutter in my life.I expected this book to be more like a well-written ""how to"" approach to digital minimalism.While there are some fantastic suggestions in this book (with real life examples to accompany it), it is SO MUCH more.It is full of research and truths of the technology industry (and the companies that own them) that are so prevalent in our world today.  I didn't realize that I was going to be reading a book about how to ""stick it"" to the huge technology corps and how doing so can improve your life, but it is what it is!This is a fantastic book that is quite inspiring, and very easy to read.  A MUST read for anybody that feels trapped by social media/technology and is looking for some real-life advice to take back control of your day.  Best book I've read in a long time.

  In 2016 Cal Newport, a computer scientist at Georgetown University, published a book about cultivating habits of undistracted work. The premise was that while everyone else was getting distracted it provided an opportunity for those with disciplined focus. Cal got the praise and push-back he expected. What he didn’t expect was how many people wrote to him asking for a book applying the same principles to their time outside the office. That is just what Cal did. He wrote a book with a simple premise: You need to be intentional about your use of technology.This is for several reasons. First, technology is not neutral. It is a product made by people who want to both enhance your life and make money. In the current technology market money is to be made by keeping your eyeballs locked on the screen in your hand. Our phones and their apps are designed to bring us in and keep us there as long as possible. While this isn’t some nefarious conspiracy, there is an illusion we have embraced. We know there is no such thing as a free lunch, but there is a free app. Facebook and Twitter are free. And so many games are free with the ability to purchase if you want to. While the apps may be free one sense, they are very costly in another. But only if you value your time.Part 1 of the book deals with foundational arguments about the nature of technology and the need to get intentional about your tech use. Cal starts with the same recommendation for each of us:Take a technology breakNot a detox. Not a week-long fast. You need to take a break for thirty days. You read that correctly. A full month with technology use reduced down to only essential functions. No mindless scrolling through feeds, endless video playlists on YouTube or binge watching Netflix. Are you breathing into a paper bag yet? You need to recover things like boredom and silence. The idea is to do a digital reset. After thirty says you begin reintroducing the technology (apps, podcasts, social media) one at a time. As you do it is imperative to decide what you will use it for and how you will use it.Get intentional about your habitsPart 2 gets into four practices for healthy life like embracing silence and time alone, refusing to like or comment on social media, reclaiming your leisure time. The book is so clear I am not going to list the chapters. Here is the summary of the book:  We need to rethink how we are using technology.  We need to do a digital reset.  We need to intentionally fill our lives with the habits that will bring meaning and help us accomplish what we want.ReflectionsI have shared before about my struggle with my smartphone. Tony Reinke’s book moved me to take my phone habits seriously. I deactivated my Facebook account. I made some adjustments. But they weren’t enough. In January I began a week-long break from social media, podcasts, etc. During that week I came across Cal’s book and immediately decided to extend it out for the full thirty days. What could happen?It made a huge difference. Once you break away from social media, it bores you to read it. Instead, I read/listened to something like eight books. I invested more time in exercise. I prayed more. I was more present with others. My Screen Time app reported I had reduced my screen time by 30% three weeks in a row. At that point I made a decision: I’m getting rid of my smartphone. And I did. I now have this bad boy. That’s right. It has a keypad. It has been a few weeks without my smartphone and everything is going well. No, I don’t think everyone should get rid of their smartphones. I just realized I didn’t actually need mine and it was actively making my life worse.I still use Twitter, but barely. My blog and sermons publish to my account so I have a specific use for it. One mistake I made was with YouTube. I didn’t define how I would use it so it quickly became a distraction. I have since ceased from using it completely until I define how/when I am using it and what I am using it for.Bottom LineI don’t want to be the obnoxious guy telling everyone how they are doing it wrong. I’m not anti-technology. I’m trying to figure out how to use technology in a way that supports my life rather than takes it over. I want to be a faithful husband, father, and pastor. There are many obstacles along the way. Some have been put there by others. Many of them I put there by accident. I can work on those. Cal Newport’s book was really helpful for me. It pushed me over the edge to take action. I think it will help you too (even if you keep your smartphone!). It is a fast read and I highly recommend it.

  TL;DR(Well, I did actually read it, but maybe you don't have to.)The book in a nutshell:- Modern phones, apps, and social media take advantage of intermittent positive reinforcement and status anxiety. Watch out for that.- If you're truly addicted to an app or social media, try going cold turkey for 30 days, refocusing on quality in-person activities, and then reintroducing the app/media with intentionality about specifically when and how you use it.- Leave your phone at home sometimes. Leave it on Do Not Disturb whenever possible. Go on long walks.- Instead of ""liking"" and commenting on your friends' social media, initiate conversations with those same people.- Have hobbies. Build stuff. Play Settlers of Catan. Do Crossfit. (The last two are examples of ""social leisure."")That's it.Deep Work was a solid purchase. This one I question.

  This book is about good leisure practices, and about how they are related to minimizinguse of digital technology in one's life. There are some nuggets of wisdom in the text, butit felt like a magazine article would have sufficed instead of this book.We have been hearing for a while now about how the internet is messing with our heads.More recently, the books' focus shifted to social media, and the manipulative tactics ofthe social media companies to keep their users hooked. This book opens with a chapter onthat subject, doing its part to promote the paranoia. It is undeniable that Facebook andothers spend a great deal of effort on making their products 'addictive'. It is also clearthat a large number of people use social media to varying extents. But there is no proofthat Facebook programmers' manipulative tactics are what are keeping Facebook usagehigh.Some programmers working behind the scenes to ""affect the thinking of billions ofusers"" is the stuff of science fiction. Sure, Facebook can make some people feel acertain emotion for a short period of time, but even a bill board can do that. But thiswhole idea of zombie-like users being affected in powerful ways is false.Unfortunately, many of the liberal authors seem to have adopted that as gospel truth. Thatseems to be how they explain away the 2016 election result. It is unthinkable to them thatpeople saw it fit to vote for Donald Trump as President. No, it has to be the 'Russian ads'on Facebook. (But nobody can explain what is so magical about the 'Russian ads' that amere $100k worth of those ads worked to change people's minds, while hundreds of millionsof dolalrs' worth of ads from Hillary Clinton utterly failed! LOL!) Newport doesn't goquite that far, though he refers to the '16 election result as a 'crisis' and seems tothink the 'Russian ads' played a role.Meanwhile, if you are not a liberal trying to explain away an election result, you willsee that millions of users quit social media on their own, or reduce their usage. Justa couple of days ago, we heard about how Facebook activity went down a whole lot aftersome of the scandals came to light. This is hardly the sign of zombies.I think Nicholas Carr had it right in The Shallows - internet use leads to shallowthinking habits. The subsequent focus of other writers on social media companies ismisplaced.

  This book makes me happy. Literally, I find myself smiling as I read this book, so grateful that someone has finally put a name (digital minimalism) to a lifestyle that I can embrace that will improve my wellbeing on every level.I have long been searching for my own answers and methods to keep technology from overtaking my life, even to the extent of creating my own ""Digital Detox"" online course for my students. I have studied ways to find balance with technology and employed many boundaries and strategies to keep my life feeling balanced.  So is there anything new to Cal Newport's approach?YES.First of all, his title is inspired.  I love having an actual ""philosophy"" about digital tools, that goes beyond implementing rules and boundaries.  Rules and boundaries only last so long. It's understanding ""why"" a rule or boundary exists that keeps one committed.  The philosophy of Digital Minimalism promotes the idea that we choose which tools best serve our values, and happy let go of the rest. A tool must give more than it takes.  This was eloquently taught by Newport in an unexpected reflection on Thoreau's New Economics principle that you must also consider your quality of life when determining what tool is worth your time and energy.I loved the suggested practices that Newport gives for how to create more solitude in your life and have already started a daily practice of walking outside in nature completely unplugged!  He also has valuable strategies on how to use your phone as a tool rather than a device that runs your life.  I do know enough to turn off notifications, but Newport's ideas went beyond this.  Already I'm seeing such great improvement in my quality of life and the automony that I have found.I have to admit, I already live a fairly minimalist digital life---I quit social media over a year ago and removed any app from my phone that would ever cause me to go down a rabbit hole.  I do a lot more than the average person to live with intention and solitude.  That being said, I'm delighted to report that this book was still a break through for me and felt like I suddenly had the philosophy and foundation for all the strategies that I've been trying to implement.  I can only imagine how earth shattering this book will be for someone currently caught in the grasp of digital addiction.  If followed, this could absolutely dramatically change one's life in the most productive and meaningful ways :)

  I don't recommend many books because most are drivel.  Most are 20 pages of info stretched into 300 pages.This book could be shorter, it's true.  But it provides immense value.  Let me explain.This book will be most useful to those who use too much technology.  Now, you may think that's not you but I would guess most people below 40 are using tech wayyyy too much.  I have started a digitla declutter and even after 5 days I feel better.  It's difficult though.  Once you eliminate digital clutter you suddenly notice you have tons of time - you really can't comprehend how much time you are looking at or using technology until you do a 30 day or however long declutter experiment.I think every person should do this if they have a smart phone or use tech frequently.  I think this could be one of the most important books you buy if you use technology frequently.The book specifically has a pholosphy section, declutter section and then a practical section (things to do).  It's wel written and more importantly well-thought out.  One of the best books I've purchased in years.  I highly recommend this and would HIGHLY recommend actually doing the declutter experiment because it could absolutely change everything about your life.  Very few books have life changing information in them... again, this would not work if youre a person who doesn't use smart phones or has technology products (laptops, desktop, use internet, etc).  But if you use tech for even 1-2 hrs a day, or sometims 6-10 hrs then you will be amazed at how much you can improve your relationships with these things.  I think anyone under 30 would benefit HUGELY from this.  I can't understate that.

  I still spend way too much time on screens, but this is a great book. Cal Newport is a very compelling and engaging writer, which is a really good thing because I'm guessing I'm not the only person who needs his work whose attention span has been shredded by excessive digital media. His arguments are clear and ideas thought provoking. After reading Digital Minimalism, I liked it so much, I bought his other two books.He has an issue sometimes confusing correlation with causation when discussing research findings in order to make his point, which is surprising to me and rather disappointing given that he's clearly highly intelligent and a critical thinker, but even with this objection (a serious frustration as a scientist) the book is so good I'm still giving it 5 stars. One of the only things I've found that takes a nuanced perspective, and works to get at the root of why digital media is both the benefit and problem it is and offers solid advice on how to navigate that.

  If you don’t think you need to detox from Twitter for a month, then you probably DO.I actually started to worry while reading. What is all my online activity doing to my brain? But Newport explains with real-life solutions how you can be part of the digital world without being controlled by it.Thirty percent of the book is cited references and the index and endnotes. Newport did a LOT of research, which I appreciate because I’d rather read a book of facts than a book of just one person’s opinion.Important book, 5 stars.

  There are a few insights in here worth reviewing, but nothing common sense didn't already inform you of: solitude is vastly important, social media is designed to keep you hooked, the attention economy doesn't give a hoot about intimacy or your analog ""craft"" passion projects, etc.There's an echelon (I wouldn't say genre per se) of books that are better formatted in whatever synoptic article version of them exists out there. I'd imagine The Atlantic or some similar publication summarizes his points -- just go find that and save yourself some time so you can get back to your digital-vegan woodworking project (har har har).

  This is a very shallow book with an important message: Decrease your dependence on technology. There is no serious examination of what constitutes over-dependence on technology. The book is replete with platitudes and anecdotal stories. The author gives plenty of common-sense examples of what is good for us to do to decrease our reliance on tech devices. ‘Leave your phone at home’; take long walks; ‘join something’, like ‘junto’ a ‘mutual self-improvement club’. The entire book is more like an after-dinner talk (and a boring one too). This has unfortunately turned out like some of his other books. ‘So Good They Can’t Ignore You’ published in 2012 is one of them. His thesis of working hard to improve your craft is more important than passion is, a little suspect, to put it mildly.

  I’ve always been a big fan of Newport’s (his “So Good They Can’t Ignore You” is required reading in my college course), and tried to read “Deep Work” awhile back but threw up my figurative hands in the air thinking, “This guy is a  total Luddite!” But it must have touched something in me because I bought this book, hoping it might give me some insight as to why I just couldn’t seem to focus on my myriad of passion projects, whether it be growing my small business or finishing my novel.Newport is pragmatic & straight-forward, giving readers a wide-range of practical ideas for reducing their screen time. But my favorite chapter was the one on Solitude, drawing wisdom from Thoreau and Lincoln. Today is Feb. 28 - tomorrow I start my 30 day detox experiment, which I’ll implement via a custom plan I put together with the help of this book. Wish me luck!

  I bought the book to learn more about Cal Newport's approach to minimalism. Can't say that I was overwhelmed with enthusiasm. While not a bad book, I found just a little too much sales-y-ness to it. Plus, as a writer, I get some great ideas while browsing the internet. Indeed, without the Internet, earning as a freelance writer would be a lot more difficult. While disconnecting from the various digital feeds could be beneficial, and cell phones can be distinctly annoying, they do have their advantages.

  This book came at the perfect time in my life. I purchased when it first came out and was part of his study mentioned in the book.Did not read until now as I am working to declutter my life physically, mentally, and digitally. This book hits a key element that will lead to success and that is that this philophy will work if""the key to sustained success with this philosophy is accepting that it’s not really about technology, but is instead more about the quality of your life.""and that as we remove things from our life we need to ""spend this period trying to rediscover what’s important to you and what you enjoy outside the world of the always-on, shiny digital.""

  I read Cal's Deep Work book, and that was so life-changing I was excited to read this newest book. I'm only halfway through but I can already tell it will be equally life-changing! I've read different things on digital declutter but what I love about Cal's book is that he approaches it from such a logical standpoint that you end up asking yourself, ""What kind of life do I really want to live?"" And what I find is that I'm being careless with technology-checking the Internet willy nilly whenever I want to know something among other things- and that that is not adding to the quality of my life!Cal suggests doing a 30 day digital declutter. What I like about the way he does this is that he gives clear steps on how to set up a personalized declutter based on your weak areas and what you need for work or family life. I'm an author, so I'm on the computer a lot just for my job, but I'm definitely on it more than I need to be in a way that makes my life worse not better. I'm only halfway through Cal's book but I'm super excited about how it will change my life!

  This is now the second book by Newport I've read in quarantine. On the first read, I found it less compelling that Deep Work but in reflecting on this and re-reading it to make notes I realize that Digital Minimalism is simply more focused and pragmatic. Newport presents a clear and alarming picture of current digital practice - and a thorough solution. His philosophy is simple in concept, counter-cultural in action, difficult to employ, but promises profound benefits for those to undertake it. These benefits aren't just personal, but promise to benefit families, workplaces, and communities. Vive la resistance!

  I read Deep Work, and I like this book even better.  Cal Newport has a very easy-going, bantering writing style.  It is enjoyable to read, but you really get a lot of good advice in this book.  I find that I don't get as much done as I'd like to by the end of the day.  I'm self employed, and I work at home.  This book has really made a difference for me, as did 'Deep Work'.  I do not identify with ALL of the chapters, the one about finding meaningful ways to fill the extra time that you will have really made me laugh.  I have plenty of meaningful hobbies to fill my time with.  So I pretty much skipped that chapter.  But the rest of the book is very good.  He manages to inspire you without sounding like he is nagging you to do the right thing.  He makes you WANT to do it.  Very good writer.

  As a high school teacher, I have seen first hand how digital tools like smartphones can be misused and how they lead to decreased personal interactions and lack of focus.  Newport presents a good case for limiting or eliminating various social media, digital tools, web sites, etc., from your life while increasing high-quality interactions with other people and high-quality activities.  I have definitely felt a shift in my own life, almost as someone looking from the outside at how the rest of the community is functioning.  I've also made an effort to reconnect with old friends and colleagues with definite positive results and feelings in my life.A very, very good book with lots of great ideas.  Highly recommended.  As a side note, I started reading one of his other books, Deep Work.  I am also getting some great ideas from it as well!

  I like that it gave a lot of sound support for the steps that the author advises. It's also not a book that makes you feel bad about yourself. I like that the author concedes that everyone's ""best life"" will look different. The trick is getting technology to serve your values and not the other way around.Before I read this book, I was already of the ""digital declutter"" mindset, but I loved the case studies and also the positive affirmation of the steps I'm trying to take to take back my life.Hoping to start a ""declutter"" (aka digital cleanse) this weekend!

  We live in a time when most children and even young adults have no remembrance of a world where no one had an all- in-one phone and sophisticated computer in their back pocket.  A world where 3 year olds didn't keep themselves occupied with their own personal iPads. A world where dinner table conversation didn't consist of everyone  putting their cell phones on the table and converse with others all over the country on any of a dozen forms of social media. Indeed, we live in a time when the world has changed and is still changing at a previously unimaginable speed.  We've never been here before, and no one knows with any certainty where we are headed or what we are going to find when we get there.But all of this is not bad.  Cal Newport does a remarkable job of sorting out the good and the bad of where we are and where we are going.  He explains how we can live in the digital world by controlling IT, and not having it control US. The way to accomplish this he calls digital minimalism.  It makes for fascinating reading, and is more than worth the effort.

Took me a while to read because I lost attention midway through, but am glad that I finished because the book does pick up steam towards its conclusion. Would recommend to most people. Some chapters are more applicable than others based on your situation. All in all, a worthy read that outlines some truly actionable suggestions to audit your interactions with technology and arrive at a happy medium.

But there's actionable advice in here, too. If you've read Cal Newport before, you probably already know if his worldview and strategies resonate with you.

  In the half decade since crossing the threshold from academia into the ""real world"" there has been a constant struggle within myself to maintain the mental focus that is expected (or at least that I expect) of a young professional looking to make an honest and lasting impact in his line of work. Looking to break free from the grasp of distractions (of which I was ignorant existed at the time), I sought various sources to aid me in my quest for the reclamation of my mind. These included therapy, medication, and ""life hacks"", of which all listed provided only temporary relief from what ""Digital Minimalism"" deemed to be my true enemy: the current implementation of social media as pushed by the attention economy conglomerates!Not even half-way through the book was Cal Newport able to convince me that the bombardment on my mind from Reddit, Facebook, and Instagram were the main culprits in jumbling my brain in such a way that left me regularly unable to form the coherent thoughts needed to be thought in my line of work. In addition, I realized that the endless cycle of scrolling and clicking through low-quality information that was beginning to define every single day of my life was depriving me of the mental solitude that is absolutely necessary to maintain focus on one's goals as well as to come up with the important ideas that have lasting impacts on one's life and even the world around them!The second half of Newport's book offers a variety of practical ways that a person struggling with the distractions that come with modern technology can use to the benefit of their focus. Without giving all the book's goods away, I will say that Newport's suggestion of deleting social media off the phone has aided me the greatest out of all of his ideas. Since implementing this change, there has been a noticeable increase in my effort to engage in productive tasks, as well as a noticeable decrease in the energy needed to start these tasks.In conclusion, I believe that ""Digital Minimalism"" contains the answers to the problems that  many zealous yet highly distracted people face on their journey to success and happiness. This book is a beacon of hope among an electronic sea of diversions, and I recommend it without hesitation.

We are being sucked into the digital world that changes on us and we just go along for the ride. I have found myself in waiting rooms, walking down the street, in my workplace etc and everyone is like zombies staring at their phones!! Its ridiculous and we have to wake up. I walk my dog and find people out walking with their faces buried in their phones *shaking my head*. I have been so so guilty of all of this, but that is about to change. I'm committing to what Cal suggests. I deactivated all social media because I do not think the good outweighs the bad (for me)! I'm looking forward to seeing how things change in the next 30 days or so. If you too feel like you are wasting your life behind a screen....I strongly urge you to check this book out!

  I participated in the digital declutter experiment described in this book last year and thought, ""I know what he's going to say in this book. Do I really need it?""The answer is yes. I'm happy to be re-energized with intentionality in my online time. I already didn't have Facebook on my phone, but this book helped me decide to delete Instagram and Twitter too. When my teenager asks why she can't have social media, now I have a clear answer.Glad to read about the science behind the default mode network. Michael Pollan also brings up that research in his latest book, How to Change the Mind. Cal Newport clearly did his homework, which I appreciate as a psychology professor.

  I am a big fan of Cals work. I definitely enjoyed this book more than deep work. Cal throws light on the problems and offers solutions to the issues of attention economy and digital distraction. However when it comes to solutions, I found it difficult to sustain the advice on digital declutter and my youtube app is back up. I wish he gave us more in depth advice as this is a hard problem. I wish the book was 70% more solution centric. Many practices were recommended but it would have been great to get an insiders view on how to implement those strategies and what is the core of digital declutter. I think something more radical, something like a Kon Mari for digital declutter is needed. I found Cals solutions a little diffuse all over the place and sometimes contradictory, could be confusing or overwhelming to some to implement. I hope he has a future blogpost with more ideas. I preordered the book and somehow found the youtube video on his own productivity methods to be more useful than the entire book. Maybe I am mistaken or I did not grasp the book. I would have given this 5 stars, maybe I was expecting too much..

  I had adopted, unknowingly, a few practices in this book from previous struggles. I read more books, sit more with good humans for tea, appreciate moments of no connection, watch less tv, read and watch less news, and thought I was being better on my use of social media. However I gained deeper insight, a broader palate of beneficial practices, and understanding of the wider struggles of the struggle of balancing time against mega industries that seek those eyes.This story gave me more value time. And this time is my current passion.

  Some have crticized this book for not saying anything “new.” My counter to that would be just because it’s old news to you doesn’t mean it’s old news to everyone else.Personally, I find the information simply and clearly presented. The author has a simple down to earth style of writing that doesn’t waste your time with lots of noise.I typically come away from one of Cal’s books motivated to think and experiment with the things he presents in my own life. Not to just blindly accept someone else’s advice, but to think, reflect, and act in my own best interest.This book is no exception. The author isn’t telling you to give up Facebook, Twitter, video games, etc. He’s simply suggesting that you engage with these things thoughtfully and intentionally. Don’t operate on autopilot when it comes to products designed specifically to take as much of your time (and sometimes money) as possible.

  For most, the takeaways on this subject could have been adequately covered in a long article. The real substance of the book was the set up in the first 81 pages. After that the quality of the material declined quickly. That said, it’s hard to say much when one is really arguing for a more thoughtful approach to cell phone usage. Cal, I’m sure, would argue it’s much deeper and more pervasive than that, but it’s really not.

  Since reading Deep Work towards the end of last year, I have started implementing some of Cal's ideas. This book provides a number of practical steps to live a more meaningful life and accomplish much more.

  As a millennial who joined on to social media in 2005, this book is exactly what I needed. I’ve been too connected for too long without thinking through exactly why I’m so connected. Declutter, putting together a strategy and plan of how to navigate social media is definitely what I intend to do.For now, I’ll continue to let my brain rest for a while, remain detached and map out future engagement plans with the platforms that I am on. There’s definitely a healthier version to navigating social media and I believe Cal shows us the way.

  Another informative and entertaining Newport product. I can’t sing enough praises for Cal Newport books. ‘Deep Work’ was an eye-opening game-changer for me. As useful as ‘FLOW’ in grooming me to systematically use the optimum learning experience as a tool to achieve lasting, relevant knowledge. ‘Digital Minimalism’ is a sobering study for readers, like me, who are deafened by the constant distraction and noise of personal technology. It provides a sensible process for differentiating what matters most VS pointless distractors.
